# Roadmap for the scoping review

The end goal is a published scoping review. How we get there is based on
completing tasks and steps along the way. This document is meant as a
starting point to know what needs to be done and what has been done.

1.  [Issue 12: Tasks to do for completing
    project](https://github.com/science-collective/scoping-review/issues/12).
    This is the main issue to get an big overview of what has been done
    and what needs to be done.
2.  [Issue 32: Tasks tracking for extracting references from
    sources](https://github.com/science-collective/scoping-review/issues/32).
    This issue shows more detailed view of what sources we've extracted
    and what still need to be done.
3.  [Issue 14: PRISMA-ScR Checklist (for both protocol and review
    itself)](https://github.com/science-collective/scoping-review/issues/14).
    This issue tracks what needs to be included in the final scoping
    review [paper](doc/paper.md) when we start writing it.

This document is continually evolving, so check back to it often! :D
