# Reflections on co-working

## 2022-01-17

-   Getting used to collaborate and discuss on github, instead of just
    using it as a repository for my own stuff.
-   Was hard to understand and process the concept of a scoping-review
    at first, but get it now!

-   It is difficult to think about efficient frameworks in which we all
    can collaborate. However, the more effort you put into the
    framework, the smoothest we will work all together.

-   I could only work from 21 to 23, so I was mostly catching up with
    stuff. The amount of things done by the collaborators sometimes can
    be overwhelming without a good reporting structure. Nobody used the
    minutes strategy, so I cannot know what they've been working on or
    what can I help with.
