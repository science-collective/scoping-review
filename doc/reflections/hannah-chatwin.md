aRxiv:
- “Open research” produced many irrelevant results
- Forgot to apply date filter – Can re-run once when we have confirmed that the search strategy is suitable
<br>
<br>
rScopus:
- scopus_search doesn’t attach abstracts, and I couldn’t get abstract_retrieval to work (seemed to produce all metadata other than the abstract)
- Many irrelevant journal articles due to abstracts mentioning “Data/material being available on the Open Science Framework” – Should we filter this out now or later (manually)?
- Do we want to exclude “corrections” and “corrigendum” results?
**Next time: Find out how to attach abstracts
**

- Still unsure what we are expecting from the data, though I guess that is the point!
- I am super keen on Luke's idea RE: using a broad search strategy and then using filtering afterwards, once we know what sort of search results we get
- Struggling to get up and running with rscopus, but just need more time

- I'm wondering how "systematic" we should be in conducting the database searches, without turning this into a systematic review
- Updated protocol
- Trialed search of MEDLINE (via Ovid)
- Need to get a better sense of the data analysis approach (e.g., come up with step-by-step guide to share with SC)
