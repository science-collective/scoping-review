-   used a lot of time figuring out how to start and what task to do

-   used a lot of time catching up to the folder structure of the
    project. Likely because I have not tried to work in this format
    before.
-   Discord is helpful to see when other people are online and
    communicate with them directly. It likely also filters some of the
    communication going to GitHub. Could be a disadvantage as some
    dicisions could be made on Discord, when everyone is not there, and
    not put down on text somewhere.

-   In general hard to find time for this project, particularly because
    there is no one for whom it is their primary project to push the
    work forward.
-   Getting the roadmap up an running has been really important because
    we only work on this once per month. This may be too infrequent to
    really progress. It is really useful with the roadmap because
    otherwise one would forget where the project is and which tasks are
    to be done.
-   There is a risk of feeling what one is doing is really fragmented
    due to the infrequent meetings
-   We could benefit from having some more deadlines to aim for to keep
    the work progressing

-   Started getting oriented in all the updated code and on GitHub -
    this is one of the advantages by having documented so much.
-   Once you start getting the sense of how everything is setup and
    connected it has become much easier to go in, find tasks to
    complete, and do them.
-   Today I mostly oriented myself in all the issues on GitHub to get an
    overview of where we are and plan my time ahead. This is my general
    struggle with this project - time. Finding time to dive in has
    really been hard amid all the other projects.

-   Feels like we got over the hump of getting started and by solving
    the search using openalex instead of many individual packages for
    each database.
-   We have curated lists of all the papers and now much easier to go
    through. Now the project feels like it is moving.

-   Was great to have set aside dedicated time to work on the project.
    Read all the papers, make a charting form and chart the papers I had
    been assigned. Next step will be making a nice overview table of all
    the papers and start writing.
-   The "sprint" of working at the same time was a really great idea but
    we should have coordinated much more beforehand and make the goal
    clear. I also have some things, still, that got into my way so I was
    more present in the first days than the last days.
-   We should schedule such a sprint again to continue with the project.
    We have come very far.
-   The biggest limitation at the moment is finding the time to work on
    this as this is no ones primary project. Prioritizing taking out
    much time for this is just not easy. But we are moving forward.
