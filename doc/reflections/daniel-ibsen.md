# Reflections on co-working

## 2022-01-17

-   used a lot of time figuring out how to start and what task to do

-   used a lot of time catching up to the folder structure of the
    project. Likely because I have not tried to work in this format
    before.
-   Discord is helpful to see when other people are online and
    communicate with them directly. It likely also filters some of the
    communication going to GitHub. Could be a disadvantage as some
    dicisions could be made on Discord, when everyone is not there, and
    not put down on text somewhere.

-   In general hard to find time for this project, particularly because
    there is no one for whom it is their primary project to push the
    work forward.
-   Getting the roadmap up an running has been really important because
    we only work on this once per month. This may be too infrequent to
    really progress. It is really useful with the roadmap because
    otherwise one would forget where the project is and which tasks are
    to be done.
-   There is a risk of feeling what one is doing is really fragmented
    due to the infrequent meetings
-   We could benefit from having some more deadlines to aim for to keep
    the work progressing
