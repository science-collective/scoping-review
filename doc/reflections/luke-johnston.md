# Reflections on co-working

## 2022-01-17

-   Realized Zoom wasn't the best for doing these types of activities,
    so will try out Discord next time!
-   Coordinating before hand was tough...

## 2022-04-07

-   Biggest challenge is coordinating and organizing how we collaborate.
    Without a good structure and guide to know what to work on, it
    sometimes feels like floundering around, unsure of what to work on.
-   Having a guide for "tasks to complete" is really helpful to stop
    "paralysis" of not knowing what to do next.

-   Big challenge is coming back to the project and not knowing what to
    work on next. So making / updating the contributing guidelines with
    tips on how to get caught up.

## 2023-05-12

-   Been a while since I got back to this, so its good to start up
    again. The README's helped and setting up the targets infrastructure
    and pipeline I think will help us later on as the project continues.

## 2024-06-06

-   Progress has been going great, the use of a targets pipeline has
    really helped, especially after coming back to work on this after a
    while. There are some areas that I wish could be more automated, but
    I think that it might not really be possible for now.
