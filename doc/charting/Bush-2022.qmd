## Characteristics of the paper

-   Type of paper (e.g., tips, example): example
-   Themes (e.g., tools, organization): tools
-   Other keywords (e.g., newcomers): workflow

## Tools

### Specific tools mentioned - their function - where in the researh process used

-   Github - open-source code, version control, collaboration -
    analysing
-   Python - open-source programming - analysing
-   R - open-source programming - analysing
-   arXiv/bioRxiv/psyRxiv - preprint sharing - disseminating
-   OpenNeuro - data sharing - disseminating
-   Open Science Framework - preregistration - planning
-   clinicaltrials.gov - preregistration - planning

## Organizational structure for open collaboration

### Workflow

-   hypothesis - experiment - data collection - data analysis -
    reporting

## Educational perspectives

### Educational needs

-   people in the organization need to learn additional programming,
    version control, and data management skills and work with unfamiliar
    naming conventions and directory structures mandated by the used
    standards

## Barriers

### Barriers for open science

-   costs of effort to be borne by individuals already engaged in
    challenging, time-consuming work
-   during transition, the research productivity will suffer
