# Charting plan folder

This is a short description of the charting plan.

1.  Each author is assigned specific papers to chart using the charting
    template
2.  The other authors reviews the charted form and updates if necessary
3.  If there are any disagreements, these will be resolved by discussion
4.  In the end, the data will be transferred to a data table
