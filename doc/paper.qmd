## Introduction

## Aims

Our original overall aim, as defined in the protocol, of this scoping
review is to identify current practices of open collaboration in
biomedical and health research.

The specific aims of this scoping review are to:

-   Provide an overview of current practices of or opinions about
    research collaboration that follow basic open principles (e.g.,
    transparency, accessibility)

-   Summarize existing online tools and resources available to improve
    open collaboration in research

We've expanded on our original aims to include a **secondary aim** of
building an open source R-based pipeline for conducting scoping reviews.
The entire source code, as well as text and collaboration workflows, are
found on our GitHub repository
[`science-collective/scoping-review`](https://github.com/science-collective/scoping-review).

## Methods

The full protocol for this scoping review was uploaded to the Open
Science Framework [@Johnston2022].

As with any research project, things evolve compared to what was
originally intended or planned. In this section we describe what was
changed from the original, uploaded protocol.

### Document types

We originally intended on searching websites, blogs, and other online
resources, but it was very difficult to programmatically and
systemtically achieve this. So we ended up only searching for scholarly
work that was indexed in databases.

### Source databases

We originally aimed to review individual archives that included PubMed,
bioRxiv, Scopus, and several others (the full list is in the protocol),
and to use R packages with web API connections to each of these sources
to programmatically extract the sources we wanted. However we
encountered substantial issues that completely changed how we actually
found and extracted the sources.

The first challenge we encountered was that, while most of the source
databases had (hypothetically) exposed APIs along with R packages
available to access them, they didn't always work well or had
complicated instructions for actually using them. For instance, the
preprint repositories bioRxiv and medRxiv didn't have an up to date R
package to access the preprints nor was the web API well described, nor
well designed. In order to effectively use it, you need to download the
entire database of preprints locally before being able to search for the
preprints you want. This made it effectively impossible to use.

The second challenge we encountered was a difference in results between
using the web API compared to using the web search interface for some
source databases. There were some small differences in search results
between the API query compared to the web-based query. We couldn't
identify or understand how these differences happened or way, though
they were quite small differences (less than 10 out of thousands of
scholarly works from the search results).

The third challenge we had was that some source databases, like the Web
of Science or Scopus, didn't work consistently between the authors. In
order to use the web API with the R packages, you need to generate a
token for authentication. However, for some authors, the token worked
fine, and for others, it didn't work at all, with no explanation or
error message. Given our interest in and aim for reproducibility, since
the same code ran differently between authors, we decided to exclude
these source databases.

Given these challenges however, we unintentionally found
[OpenAlex](https://openalex.org/), which is a public database of
scholarly output that aggregates dozens of other source databases into
one, easy interface. This resource also has an R package called
`{openalexR}` [@Aria2024] with a very well designed interface, which
simplified or made redundant much of our code we wrote. It also made it
unnecessary to use the individual R packages for each source database
that we originally listed in the protocol. By using this archive, it
resolved all our challenges and barriers we had before. For a list of
where they get their source data from, see their ["About the
data"](https://help.openalex.org/hc/en-us/articles/24397285563671-About-the-data)
page.

### Inclusion and exlucion criteria

While we didn't change our search terms for the initial search and
extraction, we found that our search terms were not precise enough and
got many irrelevant scholarly works. The full R code to filter down the
search results is kept in the
[`R/exlusions.R`](https://github.com/science-collective/scoping-review/blob/main/R/exclusions.R)
file on the GitHub repository. For example, we extracted a large number
of scholarly works describing surgery such as "open wound", electronics
such as "open circuit", or environmental such as "open water" that we
had to post-process and exclude.

### Search period

We were not able to dedicate as much time to this project as we had
initially planned, so our "stopping rule" for end date didn't match with
our actual search period. The actual end date for when we did the last
search results extraction was
[2024-02-29](https://github.com/science-collective/scoping-review/commit/f288d3f23d028e77ad1081e0cfe3583ce4dcb8b6).

## Contributions

<!-- TODO: add contributions according to: https://credit.niso.org/ -->

We originally had another author involved, HC, who is on the protocol
author list. Since the time we uploaded the protocol, she has moved out
of academia and could no longer participate in any work.

Otherwise, the remaining authors (MG, DBI, and LWJ) had the following
contribution roles, following the [CRediT](https://credit.niso.org/)
taxonomy of conceptualization, data curation, formal analysis,
investigation, methodology, writing - original draft, writing -
reviewing and editing, project administration, software, validation, and
visualization.
