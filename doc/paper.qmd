## Introduction

## Aims

Our original overall aim, as defined in the protocol, of this scoping
review is to identify current practices of open collaboration in
biomedical and health research.

The specific aims of this scoping review are to:

-   Provide an overview of current practices of or opinions about
    research collaboration that follow basic open principles (e.g.,
    transparency, accessibility)

-   Summarize existing online tools and resources available to improve
    open collaboration in research

We've expanded on our original aims to include a **secondary aim** of
building an open source R-based pipeline for conducting scoping reviews.
The entire source code, as well as text and collaboration workflows, are
found on our GitHub repository
[`science-collective/scoping-review`](https://github.com/science-collective/scoping-review).

## Methods

The full protocol for this scoping review was uploaded to the Open
Science Framework (DOI:
[`10.17605/OSF.IO/K9DR5`](https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/K9DR5)).

### Formal sources

### Informal sources

<!-- TODO: need to add how we searched online sources, like lab websites -->

## Results

### Deviations from the protocol

-   **Original timeline**: We were quite ambitious with the timeline for
    completing this scoping review. We did not adhere to the timeline.
-   **API vs web search results**: Almost all source databases had
    exposed APIs, with R packages available to access them. We chose to
    use these rather than using the web to extract the source data is
    due to our secondary aim. However, we noticed that there were some
    small differences in search results between the API query compared
    to the web-based query. We can't explain these differences, though
    they were quite minor.
-   **Exclude Web of Science source**: We were unable to connect the Web
    of Science source to R through the `{wosr}` package. Using the API
    key did not as documented in the package did not work. We decided
    that in the interest of reproducibility, that we exclude this
    source.
