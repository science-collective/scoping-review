# Project Roles

Many roles can (and will) be done by several people, but we try to at
least have a "primary" person assigned to them.

-   *Coordinator*: Assigned to **Luke**. Responsible for tracking
    progress, setting tasks, reviewing content, setting up meetings, and
    keeping an overview of what's going on in the project.
-   *Code reviewer(s)*: First assigned to **Hannah** until the writing
    phase, then **Mario**. Responsible for checking reproducibility,
    that code runs, is readable, and generally well structured.
-   *Writer*: Assigned to **Hannah**. Mainly responsible for writing the
    report, including coordinating who needs to contribute specific text
    to each section.
-   *Editor*: Assigned to **Daniel**. Responsible for reviewing,
    proofreading, and editing the report.
-   *Table generator*: Assigned to **Mario**. Responsible for
    brainstorming any potential tables we might need or use and then
    creating them for the report.
-   *Visualization generator*: Assigned to **Daniel**. Like the table
    generator, responsible for brainstorming possible figures and
    creating them for the report.
