# Open collaboration within scientific research: Where we are, where we should be, and how to get there

The overall aim of the Science Collective is to build a technical and social 
environment that encourages and makes it easy for science to be done in an open,
rigorous, and collaborative way. Since scientific research now almost always
requires working with other people. With the increasing emphasis on and demand
for science to be more open, how we collaborate together is a key component to
making science more easily open from the start of any project. But how do we
collaborate in an open and transparent way? What are the best practices and
tools we can use? What is an ideal collaborative workflow and how close or far
are we from this ideal in reality? This project aims to address some of these
questions.

Our three general outputs for this project are:

1. A scoping review looking for knowledge on current best practices and how 
researchers collaborate presently.
2. An opinionated and theoretical paper on what an ideal open collaboration
workflow and setup should look like.
3. A comparison of where we are right now and where we should be, and how
we can start moving towards the ideal.

## Brief description of the folder and file contents
