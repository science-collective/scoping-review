Responsible for tracking progress, setting tasks, reviewing content, setting up meetings, and keeping an overview of what’s going on in the project.\nCode reviewer(s): Everyone. Responsible for checking reproducibility, that code runs, is readable, and generally well structured.\nWriter: Everyone. Mainly responsible for writing the report, including coordinating who needs to contribute specific text to each section.\nEditor: Assigned to Daniel. Responsible for reviewing, proofreading, and editing the report.\nTable generator: Assigned to Mario. Responsible for brainstorming any potential tables we might need or use and then creating them for the report.\nVisualization generator: Assigned to Daniel. Like the table generator, responsible for brainstorming possible figures and creating them for the report."

And with the growing complexity and specialization in scientific practices and methods, together with globalisation of health and environmental issues, there is a great need for a paradigm shift in research collaboration to be able to tackle these challenges.\nOpen collaboration may offer this solution."

First paper was a pilot. Main aim of the project is to provide infrastructure for large-scale collaboration. Used mailing list to share information, then slack for discussions. Use Google docs for writing and documentation and github for code and data. Data analysis plans pre-registered at OSF.\nHave a website - good for newcomers and sharing info. Topic for research selected through voting. After organizing the data, they had a modelling challenge. Also discuss challenges. Main one was how to make decisions.\nLeadership team preferable. Also have author guidelines.",

(…) research questions are selected democratically - proposals for projects are submitted and members vote to select which projects will be carried out.\nLarge-scale projects also have to develop authorship guidelines, which specify the minimal conditions that one person has to fulfill to qualify for authorship\nnone of the large-scale consortia in psychology have a steady source of financing\nsetup the project to be long-lasting and build an infrastructure that they piloted\ntask forces within the project prepared different materials they then uploaded to github and pre-register",

    "text": "This document serves as a starting point to know what and how you might contribute to this project. It starts with covering the most common thing you will encounter as a contributor: Not knowing where to start or what to work on. This includes us too, since this project is largely a side project we work on.\n\nBefore getting further into the document, there are a few things you will need to know how to use in order to contribute.\n\nAt a minimum, you need to know how to use the GitHub interface for contributing. If you are just starting out, check out the GitHub’s Quickstart. Specifically, read these:\n\nGet a quick overview of using GitHub with their “Hello World” guide.\nWe follow a popular style of contributing called the “branch-based workflow”, described in the guide GitHub flow.\nWe use GitHub for many aspects of communication, described in the guide Communicating on GitHub.\n\nFor larger contributions, we strongly recommend using RStudio with Git (connected to GitHub) to write text or code. More details and resources on this are later in this guide.\n\n\n\nBecause this is a side project for us, we often work on this maybe once or twice a month. So we often forget where we are, what’s been done so far, what’s the status of the project, and what we should work on next. So let’s break it down into two topics: What’s been done so far and what to work on.\n\n\nNewly entering or returning to a project after some time is always a bit disorienting. So, if you are in this situation or feel a bit overwhelmed or confused about what’s been done or what the status of the project is, review this documents in this order:\n\nROADMAP: This document is the first place to look to see what’s been done and what the next steps are. It can help get a sense of where to focus your efforts and time.\nCommit history of the main branch: This will show a list of files changed and messages on what people have done to the project. This is the current state of the project.\nOpen Pull Requests: To see what people are current working on, so you can see what to not work on since someone is already doing it.\nClosed Pull Requests: While you can technically see this in the Commit History, checking the Closed Pull Requests gives a brief overview of what was recently done or worked on.\n\n\n\n\nIf you’ve looked over what’s been done so far and especially the ROADMAP, and still feel a bit unsure what to do work on, then follow these steps as a starting point. See the Workflow section below for instructions on how we make changes to files.\n\nReview (proofread, edit, revise) in order:\n\nREADME.md\nCONTRIBUTING.md\nROADMAP.md\n\nRead over the doc/protocol.Rmd file.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe appreciate ALL types of contributions! Contributions include:\n\nAdding to discussions on issues or in the Discord server\nReviewing and, if appropriate, approving open PRs\nProofreading and fixing typos/grammar in text\nReviewing code, running it yourself, and fixing bugs/reformatting, adding code comments\nAdding larger amounts of new text or code\n\n\n\n\nThere are two suggested ways of adding text or code: Through the GitHub interface or through RStudio. If you are adding code, we definitely recommend using the RStudio way.\nFor things like fixing typos, spelling mistakes, or grammatical errors in the documentation, you can edit directly in the GitHub web interface.\nFor bigger changes, it’s a good idea to first file an issue and make sure someone from the team agrees that it’s needed.\nIf you are adding more substantial text or code, this is the process you would use:\n\nIf you are not a member of the Science Collective GitHub organization, you will need to fork the project to your own account. If you are a member, you don’t need to fork. Then clone the Git repository onto your computer. If you haven’t done this before, we recommend using R and RStudio (with the {usethis} package):\n\nFor non-members: usethis::create_from_github(\"science-collective/scoping-review\", fork = TRUE)\nFor members: usethis::create_from_github(\"science-collective/scoping-review\")\n\nInstall the project package dependencies, while inside the RStudio R Project (scoping-review.Rproj) and in the Console, with:\n# install.packages(\"renv\")\nrenv::restore()\nNote: If you ever get frustrated with using renv, you can turn it off with renv::deactivate().\nCreate a Git branch for your pull request (PR). We recommend using usethis::pr_init(\"brief-description-of-change\") (replace the \"brief-description-of-change\" with your own text). For more details on using the usethis PR helpers, read this webpage.\nIf you need to use another package, add the package dependency by using:\nuse_package(\"PACKAGENAME\")\nMake your changes, commit to git, and then create a Pull Request by running usethis::pr_push(), and following the prompts in your browser. The title of your PR should briefly describe the change. The body of your PR should contain Fixes #issuenumber if you were working on a specific Issue.\n\n\n\n\nThere are several R package dependencies to this project. Install them by running this code in the Console while in the R Project:\n# install.packages(\"renv\")\nrenv::restore()\nIf you are on Linux, you might need to install some additional Linux packages:\nsudo apt install libcurl4-openssl-dev libxml2 \\\n  libxml2-dev libtiff-dev libjpeg-dev libpng-dev\n\n\n\nTo rebuild all the sources extracted from the different databases like Zenodo or PubMed, run this:\ntargets::tar_make()\nThis will run a pipeline to re-build and re-run all the code associated with the scoping review.\n\n\n\nPlease note that the scoping-review project is released with a Contributor Code of Conduct. By contributing to this project you agree to abide by its terms."

Distribution of Creative Commons public licenses does not create a lawyer-client or other relationship. Creative Commons makes its licenses and related information available on an “as-is” basis. Creative Commons gives no warranties regarding its licenses, any material licensed under their terms and conditions, or any related information. Creative Commons disclaims all liability for damages resulting from their use to the fullest extent possible.\nUsing Creative Commons Public Licenses\nCreative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.\n\nConsiderations for licensors: Our public licenses are intended for use by those authorized to give the public permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms and conditions of the license they choose before applying it. Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any material not subject to the license. This includes other CC- licensed material, or material used under an exception or limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors: wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors\nConsiderations for the public: By using one of our public licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If the licensor’s permission is not necessary for any reason–for example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to copyright–then that use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of the licensed material may still be restricted for other reasons, including because others have copyright or other rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests, such as asking that all changes be marked or described. Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to respect those requests where reasonable.

Who pays for whose salary? How are funds distributed?\n\nArgues that any large-scale collaboration needs to use open practices by default.\nSomething to consider when building large-scale collaboration is its continuation. If its started by one or a few people and with dedicated funding for it, what happens if that person or people leave or move on to other things? Or when the funding ends? These need to be considered at the start.\nThe ManyPrimates use GitHub, at least to host their website with some general documentation and guidelines, as well as some analysis code and data for some papers they’ve published.\nThe ManyPrimates project also set some basic standards for project file and folder structure, for pre-registering the study, etc.",

    "text": "Other notes\n\nThis was a very good paper and very relevant and detailed.\nMore inclusive term might be “open scholarship”\nApplying openness can be very challenging when it involves data on children, but also that data on children is difficult to collect and benefits substantially from researchers using open practices, especially open data.\nThe WomCogDev lab is a fairly small group (~13 people), almost all of whom are students (e.g. Masters, undergraduates, PhD students).\nGeneral steps in their workflow:\n\nDesign project\nPre-register project or Registered Report\nCreate experiment\nRecruit participants and collect data\nAnalyze data\nDisseminate results\n\nFocus on 1, 4, and 5 since they say those are less discussed in the literature.\nFor 1, involves writing something up by the lead researcher, getting feedback from all lab, writing detailed plan, upload to OSF, decide on authorship.\n\nMaking hypothesis and thinking of what all possible outcomes for results and what that means in the context of the hypothesis\nA Data Management Plan is also created at this stage that includes details about how to be FAIR\n\nFor 2, they start off with trying to do a Registered Report, but if it gets rejected, they will take the reviewer comments, revise and make edits, and then upload to OSF as a pre-registered protocol.\nFor 3, they do not have a common programming language for creating experiments but do prioritize open source over proprietary.\nFor 4, something they do to help with reproducibility is to use “data partners”, which is someone who is in the lab but not directly involved in the specific project. Their task is to re-analyse the data to see if they come to the same conclusions as the lead author. Generally, the data partner is a PhD student or more senior.\nTools used:\n\nSlack for communication\nTrello board\nOSF, which has components made for literature, documents, methods, raw data, experiment details, analysis and results, manuscript, and communication (e.g. for outreach). Made private at first.\nR or JASP for analysis\nbioRxiv/PsyArXiv for preprints\n\nPhilosophy:\n\nMore work done upfront, the less work done later.\nSome openness is better than no openness.\nOpenness is on a spectrum.\nAlways improving and can’t always do everything at once.\n\nOther workflows notes:\n\nEach weekly lab meeting, people start with “an interesting error I found…” to encourage self-correction and open and honest dialogue and discussions\nThey have a lab manual which describes these processes.\nNot all projects follow this workflow, nor are they open.\nTry to build the values into the work culture\n\nAdvantages of workflow:\n\nUncertainty is reduced\nReproducibility is inherent to the design and practice of the workflow\n\nDisadvantages of workflow:\n\nCan sometimes be quite time-consuming\nCan be difficult to get everyone on board and to follow it fairly closely\nSteep learning curve\nOverreliance on OSF, which has a cap on amount of data to put into it",

Use open formats for data. Use GitHub to share and collaborate on projects.\n\nStrategy: Develop networks of open collaboration\n\nBuild networks of working with others in an open way.\nDevelop standards, frameworks, and templates to follow within this network.\n\nStrategy: Voice your opinions\n\nWrite things in support of these initiatives\nOutline values and principles to follow\n\nStrategy: Rethink and promote changes in assessment of scholarship\n\nPush for and advocate for alternatives to assessments outside of the typical impact factor and h-index\n\nStrategy: Create opportunities for people to specialize in open science\nTools:\n\nOSF, GitHub, Zenodo, R, Quarto, R Markdown, Jupyter Notebooks",

    "section": "Methods",
    "text": "Methods\nThe full protocol for this scoping review was uploaded to the Open Science Framework (2). As with any research project, things evolve compared to what was originally intended or planned. In this section we briefly re-state what we described in the protocol and especially we describe what was changed from the protocol.\nThis is a scoping review, so we followed the framework described in (4) as well as the guidelines outlined in the PRISMA-ScR statement (5).\n\nDeviations and challenges\nWe originally aimed to review individual archives that included PubMed, bioRxiv, Scopus, and several others (the full list is in the protocol), and to use R packages with web API connections to each of these sources to programmatically extract the sources we wanted. However we encountered substantial issues that completely changed how we actually found and extracted the sources.\nThe first challenge we encountered was that, while most of the source databases had (hypothetically) exposed APIs along with R packages available to access them, they didn’t always work well or had complicated instructions for actually using them. For instance, the preprint repositories bioRxiv and medRxiv didn’t have an up to date R package to access the preprints nor was the web API well described, nor well designed. In order to effectively use it, you need to download the entire database of preprints locally before being able to search for the preprints you want. This made it effectively impossible to use.\nThe second challenge we encountered was a difference in results between using the web API compared to using the web search interface for some source databases. There were some small differences in search results between the API query compared to the web-based query. We couldn’t identify or understand how these differences happened or way, though they were quite small differences (less than 10 out of thousands of scholarly works from the search results).\nThe third challenge we had was that some source databases, like the Web of Science or Scopus, didn’t work consistently between the authors. In order to use the web API with the R packages, you need to generate a token for authentication. However, for some authors, the token worked fine, and for others, it didn’t work at all, with no explanation or error message. Given our interest in and aim for reproducibility, since the same code ran differently between authors, we decided to exclude these source databases.\nWe also originally intended on searching websites, blogs, and other online resources, but it was very difficult to programmatically and systemtically achieve this. So we ended up only searching for scholarly work that were indexed in databases.\nGiven these challenges however, we unintentionally found OpenAlex, which is a public database of scholarly output that aggregates dozens of other source databases into one, easy interface. This resource also has an R package called {openalexR} (6) with a very well designed interface, which simplified or made redundant much of our code we wrote. It also made it unnecessary to use the individual R packages for each source database that we originally listed in the protocol. By using this archive, it resolved all our challenges and barriers we had before. For a full list of where they get their source data from, see their “About the data” page.\n\n\nDocument selection\nWe developed the initial search strategy in consultation with a research librarian. We collected the data via systematic searches of databases. All authors were involved in reviewing the collected sources, from reviewing the titles, to abstracts, and finally to full-text documents.\n\nInformation sources\nWe used OpenAlex, after encountering the challenges described above, which is an open database with scholarly works from Microsoft Academic Graph, Crossref, ORCID, ROR, DOAJ, Unpaywall, Pubmed, Pubmed Central, the ISSN International Centre, Internet Archive, Web crawls, subject-area and institutional repositories from arXiv and Zenodo.\n\n\nSearch terms\nWe used the following search terms when searching for scholarly work:\n\n(open[title]) AND (science OR research) AND (collaborating OR collaboration OR collaborate OR team OR cooperate OR cooperation OR cooperating) AND (technology OR technologies OR tool OR framework OR guideline OR principles OR practices OR systems OR resources)\n\n\n\nInclusion and exclusion criteria\nInclusion criteria included any document where open collaboration practices are not the primary focus. We relied on the definition of open collaboration from (1) in determining whether the records were relevant. Any published document with reporting on current open collaboration practices. Any published document with advice, guidance, tools, and/or recommendations for improving open collaboration. Article language in English. Exclusion criteria were documents that do not report on specific open collaboration practices.\nWhile we didn’t change our search terms for the initial search and extraction, we found that our search terms were not precise enough and got many irrelevant scholarly works. The full R code to filter down the search results is kept in the R/exlusions.R file on the GitHub repository. For example, we extracted a large number of scholarly works describing surgery such as “open wound”, electronics such as “open circuit”, or environmental such as “open water” that we had to post-process and exclude.\n\n\nCharting procedure\nAt least two of us extracted data using a standardized and tested template. Data regarding the data source (e.g., author, title, publication year), open collaboration practices, and any other relevant information, will be extracted. Extracted data will be summarized with the descriptive analytical method described in (3), which is aimed at identifying and summarizing different open collaboration practices.\n\n\nSearch period\nWe were not able to dedicate as much time to this project as we had initially planned, so our “stopping rule” for end date didn’t match with our actual search period. The actual end date for when we did the last search results extraction was 2024-02-29.\nThe start date remained 5 years from our end date, which would have been approximately 2019-02-28."

    "text": "Results\n\nScoping review identifies only 11 papers discussing open collaboration\n\n\nPractices of open collaboration\nAcross the papers found in our literature search, X out of 11 discuss actual experiences on implementing open collaboration, albeit in different organizational levels. These range from lab level (Turoman et al) center level (Bush et al and Grange et al), multi-center level (ManyPrimates et al and Grange et al) and field level: psychology (Alessandorni et al), Spinal Cord injury (Torres-Espin et al) and neuroimaging (Niso et al). All of these share in common the need for an infrastructure that promotes open science and open collaboration via starting building a community of collaborators or making tools (usually online resources) that researchers can use to reach FAIR (Finndable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) goals while doing research. Before delving in those, here we provide the specific needs for implementing open collaboration in each organizational level, as well as describing the differences in approaches among experiences between and across levels (Figure 2).\n\nImplementation of open collaboration practices at laboratory level\n\n\nImplementation of open collaboration practices at center level\nFor center-level only one paper was identified (Bush et al), providing the example of a center of neuroimaging describing first how they identified the needs for open collaboration, then the individual-level practices that researchers should adapt and then the center-level changes to promote reaching FAIR goals.\n\n\nImplementation of open collaboration practices at multi-center level\nInterestingly, the level of organization with most papers is the multi-center level with two papers from ManyPrimates et al (ManyPrimates 2019 and ManyPrimates 2021) and Grange et al. In this organization level the most urgent needs are: 1) identifying the needs for open collaboration and 2) creating an infrastructure that allows those needs to be satisfied. Indeed, Grange et al describes a systematic review as an exploration of the needs for 11 UKRN centers to implement open collaborative practives. In this paper they specially focus on tools and resources among the 11 institutions and make clear the need for starting to utilize open resources as a first step to adapt open collaborative practices. The first paper from ManyPrimates et al [REF] describes the start of another multi-center collaboration, albeit from different institutions. It is interesting to observe that in this situation, the complex issue is to start the collaboration itself, which was ignited thanks to a symposium and an email chain among future collaborators. In contrast, ManyPrimates could quickly develop an open collaborative structure with relative ease in comparison to changing an already solid infrastructure, like in the case of Grange et al.\n\n\nImplementation of open collaboration practices at field level\n\n\n\nUseful tools for open collaboration"

This document is meant as a starting point to know what needs to be done and what has been done.\n\nIssue 12: Tasks to do for completing project. This is the main issue to get an big overview of what has been done and what needs to be done.\nIssue 32: Tasks tracking for extracting references from sources. This issue shows more detailed view of what sources we’ve extracted and what still need to be done.\nIssue 14: PRISMA-ScR Checklist (for both protocol and review itself). This issue tracks what needs to be included in the final scoping review paper when we start writing it.\n\nThis document is continually evolving, so check back to it often! :D"
