Alessandroni_2022,Ten strategies to foster open science in psychology and beyond,guide,"organization, tools, education",researcher,use open tools for collaboration; develop guidelines that ensure effective communication among collaborators,markdown/quarto for collaborative writing; Github/Gitlab for version control,introduce open science practices into courses; institutions can create courses in open science practices,incorporating open tools may have a steep learning curve; concerns about data safety; high prices for making papers open; open science in the curricula vitae of academics must become a requirement; problems with current incentive structures such as impact factor
Niso_2022,Open and reproducible neuroimaging: From study inception to publication,guide,tools,researcher,,protocolexchange for examples of Standard Operating Procedures; Open Science Framework for preregistration; Hierarchical Event Descriptor for naming conventions; DataLad for handling data; Fuzzy for multiverse analysis; BrainLife for analysis; COBIDAS for for best practices,,
Turoman_2022,Open and reproducible practices in developmental psychology research: The workflow of the WomCogDev lab as an example,example,"organization, tools",research group,setup a structure for how to conduct the research considering open science in each step; build in steps for error correction,Slack for communication; Trello for project management; Open Science Framework for repository; R for data analysis; Jasp for data analysis; Zenodo for data sharing; OpenNeuro for data sharing,,"not everyone have the same prerequisites; tradeoffs between trying to be as open as possible, and the feasibility of applying an open practice; some practices can take additional time; the learning curve can be steep"
Sholler_2019,Ten simple rules for helping newcomers become contributors to open projects,guide,"organization, education",research group,"make governance explicit, e.g. have clear documents describing who are in leadership positions, who makes decisions, and how decisions are made; include forms of legitimate peripheral participation that newcomers are most likely to start doing, such as commenting on issues or     discussions or creating issues when they find something that needs attention",,develop contributing guidelines and code of conduct; develop material to make it easy for people to get started such as instructions for newcomers on how to collaborate,
Bush_2022,Lessons Learned: A Neuroimaging Research Center's Transition to Open and Reproducible Science,example,tools,research center,,"Github for open-source code, version control, collaboration; Python for open-source programming; R for open-source programming;  arXiv/bioRxiv/psyRxiv for preprint sharing; OpenNeuro for data sharing;  Open Science Framework for preregistration; clinicaltrials.gov for preregistration; Brain imaging data structure (BIDS) for common and standardized data; ReproBIDS for dictionary with standardized terms for BIDS neuro data","people in the organization need to learn additional programming, version control, and data management skills; unfamiliar with naming conventions and directory structures mandated by the used standards","costs of effort to be borne by individuals already engaged in challenging, time-consuming work; during transition, the research productivity will suffer"
Khors_2023,Eleven Strategies for Making Reproducible Research and Open Science Training the Norm at Research Institutions,survey,"organization, education",research center,"build communities by organizing regular meetings; foster accessible discussions, e.g., running beginner and advanced community meetings; set open science requirements in the CV needed to hire individuals ",,"education is a central aspect of the structure to build open science as the norm in an institution; offering open science courses, but also integreate open science in other courses; hands-on training is the best way to learn; perform replication or meta-research studies as course projects; an essential part of education is allowing for spaces where researchers can work, such as journal clubs, resource hubs or hackathons",allocation of resources; open science not part of the standard curriculum of universities or a required skill for when hiring; lack of spaces and infrastructure to network and collaborate; innovative papers being preferred by mainstream media than replications
ManyPrimates_2021,Collaboration and Open Science Initiatives in Primate Research,example,"organization, tools",multiple centers,"developed a mailing list where researchers can exchange their ideas and analysis; developed a twitter (now X) account to disseminate and extend their work to other researchers; developed ethical guidelines for all collaborators; proposals for projects are submitted and members vote to select which projects will be carried out; initial project was a pilot study that tried replicating a previous analysis; preregistered protocols, created code and hosted data in repositories so that other coworkers can run the analysis; important with a good test study; task forces within the project prepared different materials they then uploaded to github and pre-register","Github for version control; Registered reports for designing analysis; p-curve software for avoiding overrepresantation of positive results; A.P.E.S Wiki for open access standardized research and conservation of the data; PRIMatE Research Exchange for exchange of data, ideas and protocols",large-scale collaboration are a great opportunity for making more researchers get in touch with open science practices; creating websites like A.P.E.S Wiki or a mailing list creates a network of researchers that can follow similar practices; replication studies can be of great educational value and help set up infrastructure to promote openness,"pre-registration might neglect innovation due to their rigid structure, but creates very solid results"
ManyPrimates_2019,Collaborative open science as a way to reproducibility and new insights in primate cognition research,example,tools,multiple centers,,GitHub for sharing materials and archiving; mailing lists for communication; Google Docs for collaborative writing; Google Drive for sharing of procedures and documentation; Slack for communication; Open Science Framework for archiving protocols and analysis plans; organization website for sharing news and communicate updates,,"impossible to use the exact same methods across all studies, so re-using of methods and materials was not directly useful; not enough funding to hire relevant expertise and technical resources; lacked a clear governance structure"
Dora_2024,Accelerating addiction research via Open Science and Team Science,guide,organization,research field,setup a structure for leadership of the project and that the leadership is held accountable to decisions made; used anonymous polls to make critical decisions in a large collaborative project setup a structure to regularly ask for formal and informal feedback,,education in open science needed to increase uptake,no open science standards in journals; few opportunities for registered reports; there are few incentives to collaborate in large teams; grants are often given to an individual not a team
Grange_2023,UKRN Open Research Training Resources and Priorities Working Paper,survey,education,research field,,,"no educational infrastructure on open access; 62% of the resources don't have a certain trainer, indicating that researchers learn by themselves; most of the resources are decentralized (online); a common online infrastructure that guides researchers would is needed","most of open sources for training researchers in open science are involved in planning or analysis, which hinders the educational loop of open science; few resources are destinied to reproducibility, which also hinders open science; the sources of highest quality are not often open"
TorresEspin_2021,Promoting FAIR Data Through Community-driven Agile Design: the Open Data Commons for Spinal Cord Injury (odc-sci.org),example,"organization, tools",research field,"executive board for oversight and be involved in executive decisions;community board to engage in community, get feedback from workshops; data science team for data curation, quality control, and revision","GitHub to build websites; Agile development for iteratively developing projects and help with project management; workflow, planning, development; Staged development to distinct stages mixed with iterations",,"building an open collaboration project takes years of continued work and effort; while the project's output is a data sharing platform, the process to get there required a high level of collaboration; required a lot of expertise not typically found in researchers, e.g. software development, UI/UX design, data engineering, writing user-friendly documentation/tutorials; required getting regular direct feedback from potential users of project"
