    title: 'Open and reproducible neuroimaging: From study inception to publication'
    publication_date: '2022-11-01'
    abstract: Empirical observations of how labs conduct research indicate that the
      adoption rate of open practices for transparent, reproducible, and collaborative
      science remains in its infancy. This is at odds with the overwhelming evidence
      for the necessity of these practices and their benefits for individual researchers,
      scientific progress, and society in general. To date, information required for
      implementing open science practices throughout the different steps of a research
      project is scattered among many different sources. Even experienced researchers
      in the topic find it hard to navigate the ecosystem of tools and to make sustainable
      choices. Here, we provide an integrated overview of community-developed resources
      that can support collaborative, open, reproducible, replicable, robust and generalizable
      neuroimaging throughout the entire research cycle from inception to publication
      and across different neuroimaging modalities. We review tools and practices supporting
      study inception and planning, data acquisition, research data management, data
      processing and analysis, and research dissemination. An online version of this
      resource can be found at https://oreoni.github.io. We believe it will prove helpful
      for researchers and institutions to make a successful and sustainable move towards
      open and reproducible science and to eventually take an active role in its future
      development.

    title: Ten simple rules for helping newcomers become contributors to open projects
    publication_date: '2019-09-12'
    abstract: "To survive and thrive, a must attract new members, retain them, and help
      them be productive [1]. As openness becomes the norm in research, software development,
      and education, knowing how to do this has become an essential skill for principal
      investigators and managers alike. A growing body of knowledge in sociology, anthropology,
      education, and software engineering can guide decisions about how to facilitate
      this.\r\n\r\nWhat exactly do we mean by community? In the case of open source
      and open science, the most usual meaning is a community of practice. As defined
      by Lave and Wenger [2, 3], groups as diverse as knitting circles, oncology researchers,
      and web designers share three key characteristics:\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipants have
      a common product or purpose that they work on or toward.\r\n\r\n\r\nThey are mutually
      engaged, i.e., they assist and mentor each another.\r\n\r\n\r\nThey develop shared
      resources and domain knowledge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBrown [4] specializes this to define
      a community of as\r\n\r\n…a formed in pursuit of a common goal. The goal can be
      definite or indefinite in time, and may not be clearly defined, but it is something
      that (generally speaking) the is aligned on.\r\n\r\nPeople working to preserve
      coral reefs in the face of global climate change are an example of such a community.
      No central organization coordinates their work, but the scientists who study coral
      reefs, the environmentalists who work to protect them, and the citizens who support
      them financially and politically are aware of each other’s efforts, collaborate
      in ad hoc ways, and are conscious of contributing toward a shared purpose.\r\n\r\nOpen-source
      software projects are also communities of effort. E.g., the Mozilla Firefox [5]
      includes a mix of paid professionals, highly involved volunteers, and occasional
      contributors who not only create software, documentation, and tutorials but also
      organize events, answer questions in online forums, mentor newcomers, and advocate
      for open standards.\r\n\r\nEvery of effort has unique features, but they have
      enough in common to profit from one another’s experience. The 10 rules laid out
      below are based on studies of such communities and on the authors’ experience
      as members, leaders, and observers. Our focus is on small and medium-sized projects,
      i.e., ones that have a handful of to a few hundred participants and are a few
      months to a few years old but may not (yet) have any formal legal standing, such
      as incorporation as a nonprofit."

    title: Collaborative open science as a way to reproducibility and new insights in
      primate cognition research
    publication_date: '2019-10-31'
    abstract: The field of primate cognition studies how primates, including humans,
      perceive, process, store, retrieve, and use information to guide decision making
      and other behavior. Much of this research is motivated by a desire to understand
      how these abilities evolved. Large and diverse samples from a wide range of species
      are vital to achieving this goal. In reality, however, primate cognition research
      suffers from small sample sizes and is often limited to a handful of species,
      which constrains the evolutionary inferences we can draw. We conducted a systematic
      review of primate cognition research published between 2014 and 2019 to quantify
      the extent of this problem. Across 574 studies, the median sample size was 7 individuals.
      Less than 15% of primate species were studied at all, and only 19% of studies
      included more than one species. Further, the species that were studied varied
      widely in how much research attention they received, partly because a small number
      of test sites contributed most of the studies. These results suggest that the
      generalizability of primate cognition studies may be severely limited. Publication
      bias, questionable research practices, and a lack of replication attempts may
      exacerbate these problems. We describe the ManyPrimates project as one approach
      to overcoming some of these issues by establishing an infrastructure for large-scale
      collaboration in primate cognition research. Building on similar initiatives in
      other areas of psychology, this approach has already yielded one of the largest
      and most diverse primate samples to date and enables us to ask many research questions
      that can only be addressed through collaboration.

    title: Privacy, Anonymity, and Perceived Risk in Open Collaboration
    publication_date: '2019-05-02'
    abstract: Anonymity can enable both healthy online interactions like support-seeking
      and toxic behaviors like hate speech. How do online service providers balance
      these threats and opportunities? This two-part qualitative study examines the
      challenges perceived by open collaboration service providers in allowing anonymous
      contributions to their projects. We interviewed eleven people familiar with organizational
      decisions related to privacy and security at five open collaboration projects
      and followed up with an analysis of public discussions about anonymous contribution
      to Wikipedia. We contrast our findings with prior work on threats perceived by
      project volunteers and explore misalignment between policies aiming to serve contributors
      and the privacy practices of contributors themselves.

    title: The potential of inclusive and collaborative Open Research processes at the
      science-policy interface
    publication_date: '2023-01-11'
    abstract: Proponents of Open Research often assert that it can support evidence-based
      policy-making by making scientific outputs more readily available to policy-makers
      and other policy actors, yet there is little empirical work to support or deny
      this claim. This paper fills this void by reporting the results of a qualitative
      study with researchers who regularly work at the science-policy interface. We
      found that there is little evidence that Open Research products, namely Open Access
      and open data, which aim at increasing access and transparency, are useful in
      integrating science into policy-making. Instead, we found that the cognitive accessibility
      of research outputs is more important than their physical accessibility, and that
      inclusive and collaborative Open Research processes, like upstream engagement,
      co-creation and Citizen Science, are most effective at doing so.

    title: Exploring Open Science Practices in Behavioural Public Policy Research
    publication_date: '2023-05-10'
    abstract: 'In their book `Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth and Happiness'',
      Thaler and Sunstein argue that choice architectures are promising public policy
      interventions. This research programme motivated the creation of so-called `nudge
      units'' which aim to apply insights from behavioural science to improve public
      policy. We take a close look at a meta-analysis of the evidence gathered by two
      of the largest and most influential nudge units using statistical techniques to
      detect reporting biases. We find evidence suggestive of selective reporting on
      the full dataset, although this pattern is not robust in subgroup analyses. We
      therefore additionally evaluate the public pre-analysis plans from the Office
      of Evaluation Sciences. We find that the analysis plans and reporting usually
      lack sufficient detail to evaluate (unintentional) reporting biases. Nevertheless,
      we identify several instances of excellent practice. We additionally highlight
      several improvements that would enhance the effectiveness of the pre-analysis
      plans and reports as a means to combat reporting biases. We believe our findings
      and suggestions can further improve the evidence base on which policy decisions
      are made.'

    title: Eleven Strategies for Making Reproducible Research and Open Science Training
      the Norm at Research Institutions
    publication_date: '2023-05-28'
    abstract: 'Across disciplines, researchers increasingly recognize that open science
      and reproducible research practices may accelerate scientific progress by allowing
      others to reuse research outputs and by promoting rigorous research that is more
      likely to yield trustworthy results. While initiatives, training programs, and
      funder policies encourage researchers to adopt reproducible research and open
      science practices, these practices are uncommon in many fields. Researchers need
      training to integrate these practices into their daily work. We organized a virtual
      brainstorming event, in collaboration with the German Reproducibility Network,
      to discuss strategies for making reproducible research and open science training
      the norm at research institutions. Here, we outline eleven strategies, concentrated
      in three areas: (1) offering training, (2) adapting research assessment criteria
      and program requirements, and (3) building communities. We provide a brief overview
      of each strategy, offer tips for implementation, and provide links to resources.
      Our goal is to encourage members of the research community to think creatively
      about the many ways they can contribute and collaborate to build communities,
      and make reproducible research and open science training the norm. Researchers
      may act in their roles as scientists, supervisors, mentors, instructors, and members
      of curriculum, hiring or evaluation committees. Institutional leadership and research
      administration and support staff can accelerate progress by implementing change
      across their institutions.'

      in the Design Field'
    publication_date: '2019-03-01'
    abstract: The article explores the concept of “openness” in the design field. In
      particular, it suggests a broad interpretation of the relationship between “openness”
      and design by analyzing the use of the expression “open design” between 2000 and
      2017. This expression is related to words such as, co-design, crowdsourcing, open
      innovation, making and open manufacturing, which can be synthesized by the concepts
      of open source, collaboration, and access. The article finally expresses, through
      a critical point of view, the reasons why open processes in design have limitations.

    abstract: The current paper presents an overview of the workflow of the Working
      Memory, Cognition and Development lab (WomCogDev) lab at the University of Geneva,
      Switzerland, as an example of how Open Science principles can be applied in a
      developmental psychology lab. We describe the importance and challenges of applying
      Open Science practices in developmental research and detail each step of our workflow
      from research design to dissemination. We provide examples and give emphasis to
      steps that typically receive little attention but that may hold promise for application
      in other labs (namely, project design, data collection, and data analysis). Finally,
      we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of our workflow, and summarize the
      main takeaways for other labs. By ‘opening up’ our lab’s workflow, we want to
      encourage other labs to incorporate the aspects that they like into their own
      workflows and to share their own processes for the continued benefit of others.

    title: Collaboration and Open Science Initiatives in Primate Research
    publication_date: '2021-03-25'
    abstract: Traditionally, primate cognition research has been conducted by independent
      teams on small populations of a few species. Such limited variation and small
      sample sizes pose problems that prevent us from reconstructing the evolutionary
      history of primate cognition. In this chapter, we discuss how large-scale collaboration,
      a research model successfully implemented in other fields, makes it possible to
      obtain the large and diverse datasets needed to conduct robust comparative analysis
      of primate cognitive abilities. We discuss the advantages and challenges of large-scale
      collaborations and argue for the need for more open science practices in the field.
      We describe these collaborative projects in psychology and primatology and introduce
      ManyPrimates as the first, successful collaboration that has established an infrastructure
      for large-scale, inclusive research in primate cognition. Considering examples
      of large-scale collaborations both in primatology and psychology, we conclude
      that this type of research model in primate cognition.

    abstract: Open science can accelerate the pace of research and contribute to a more
      equitable society. However, the current culture of scientific research is not
      optimally structured to promote extensive sharing of a range of outputs. In this
      policy position paper, we outline current open science practices and key bottlenecks
      in their broader adoption. We propose that national science agencies create a
      digital infrastructure framework that would standardize open science principles
      and make them actionable. We also suggest ways of redefining research success
      to align better with open science, and to incentivize a system where sharing various
      research outputs is beneficial to researchers.

    title: Open and collaborative tools for disaster management and risk reduction
    publication_date: '2022-09-01'
    abstract: In recent years geo-information technologies have significant increase
      in various domain implementations.Such methodologies and applications are gathering
      more interest in aspects such as data collection, processing, analyses, and dissemination.Covering
      the full processing cycle, these technologies are impacting many fields, even
      those where traditionally there were no or few geospatial specialists.A relevant
      example can be the domain of Disaster Management and Risk Reduction (DMRR), where
      geo-information is providing powerful tools for effective management in the prevention,
      preparedness, response and recovery processes, which are of high interest to authorities
      and stakeholders.However, in certain cases, an important aspect is still under-considered
      -the "power of the crowd", which can bring vital knowledge and strength.Recently,
      also hazard specialists started to elicit the participation of citizens and to
      promote collaborative approaches in their mitigation strategies, whether it is
      for data collection (local or remotely), or to reduce the time a certain task
      is done, or simply to further disseminate knowledge and practices.As it is becoming
      a multi-field and multiapplication domain, with our contribution we want to present
      the state of the art of the open and collaborative tools that are applied in DMRR,
      regardless of the hazard type, of the used platform (mobile, desktop) and the
      approach (remote, onsite).In addition, tools currently applied in other domains,
      but that can be fruitfully used also in DMMR will be included in our speech.

    title: Knowledge and practices of open science among scholars and researchers in
      Tanzania
    publication_date: '2022-12-19'
    abstract: The Open Science (OS) movement has been spreading rapidly among researchers
      with positive outcomes on accessibility of scientific knowledge. However, there
      is no clear evidence on the level of awareness and types of OS practices among
      scholars and researchers in Tanzania, potentially missing an opportunity to reap
      the rewards of the movement to scholarly pursuits. This study investigated the
      level of awareness of OS and practices among Tanzanian scholars and researchers.
      Findings of a digital survey conducted for three months and recruited 144 respondents,
      show a high level of awareness of the term OS for 84% of respondents, most of
      them having encountered it from peers or online sources including social media.
      About 69% of respondents were male while about 44% of respondents were early career
      professionals. Open access (OA) publishing was the most common OS activity practised
      by respondents, highlighting both the need to create awareness on other practices
      and an entry point for knowledge expansion. However, respondents highlighted the
      barriers to spreading of the OS movement in the country including lack of awareness,
      knowledge and skills, the lack of institutional support and concerns over data
      security and ownership. Findings of this study establish OA as the most common
      and important OS practice among Tanzanian scholars. They show the importance of
      online resources and peers to peer learning and in spreading OS awareness. The
      study also reveals several areas of advocacy and including setting supportive
      institutional policies and building infrastructure to support OS practices. We
      recomment establisment of robust guidelines, institutional support and clear opportunities
      to incentivize individuals to adopt OS practices ao as to achieve the momentum
      required to scale the movement beyond OA.

    title: Ten strategies to foster open science in psychology and beyond
    publication_date: '2022-06-03'
    abstract: The scientific community has long recognized the benefits of open science.
      Today, governments and research agencies worldwide are increasingly promoting
      and mandating open practices for scientific research. However, for open science
      to become the by-default model for scientific research, researchers must perceive
      open practices as accessible and achievable. A significant obstacle is the lack
      of resources providing a clear direction on how researchers can integrate open
      science practices in their day-to-day workflows. This article outlines and discusses
      ten concrete strategies that can help researchers use and disseminate open science.
      The first five strategies address basic ways of getting started in open science
      that researchers can put into practice today. The last five strategies are for
      researchers who are more advanced in open practices to advocate for open science.
      Our paper will help researchers navigate the transition to open science practices
      and support others in shifting toward openness, thus contributing to building
      a better science.

    title: 'Lessons Learned: A Neuroimaging Research Center’s Transition to Open and
      Reproducible Science'
    publication_date: '2022-07-06'
    abstract: 'Human functional neuroimaging has evolved dramatically in recent years,
      driven by increased technical complexity and emerging evidence that functional
      neuroimaging findings are not generally reproducible. In response to these trends,
      neuroimaging scientists have developed principles, practices, and tools to manage
      this complexity as well as to enhance the rigor and reproducibility of neuroimaging
      science. We group these best-practices under four categories: experiment pre-registration,
      FAIR data principles, reproducible neuroimaging analyses, and open science. While
      there is growing recognition of the need to implement these best-practices there
      exists little practical guidance of how to accomplish this goal. In this work,
      we describe lessons learned from efforts to adopt these best-practices within
      the Brain Imaging Research Center at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences
      over four years (July 2018 – May 2022). We provide a brief summary of the four
      categories of best-practices. We then describe our center’s scientific workflow
      (from hypothesis formulation to result reporting) and detail how each element
      of this workflow maps onto these four categories. We also provide specific examples
      of practices or tools that support this mapping process. Finally, we offer a roadmap
      for the step-wise adoption of these practices, providing evidence-based recommendations
      of why and what to do as well as a summary of cost-benefit tradeoffs for each
      step of the transition.'

    title: Open Communitition
    publication_date: '2021-11-13'
    abstract: '&lt;p&gt;The recent enthusiasm in popular culture for massively multiplayer
      online environments has proven that eclectic online communities have the potential
      to develop powerful problem solving capacities through the enactment of a collective
      intelligence. In collaborative design, this calls for the implementation of a
      shared environment leveraging the collective intelligence of online communities
      through open competition. The goal is to spur innovation through a public process
      where the emerging design ideas are available to all competitors. Foreseeing a
      radical change in the identity of the architect, becoming but the designer of
      these emergent communal design environments, this paper aims at making the case
      for this alternate CAAD model through the execution of a pilot study. This study,
      based on the Serpentine Pavilion procedural framework, sends a sample group of
      designers to a shared videogame environment, where they are asked to create their
      own pavilion using a kit of parts drawn from the reverse engineering of Frank
      Gehry’s 2008 pavilion. These iterations are scored in real time against a set
      of quantitative programmatic requirements, but they are also assessed qualitatively
      through more subjective criteria by the community of competitors, enriched by
      the immersive virtual experience of each other’s designs. Observation and analysis
      of participants has been undertaken through the recording of design sessions and
      online survey. This pilot study is currently being undertaken, yet the initial
      results hint at displaying much potential for a participative, intuitive and instantaneous
      form of collaborative CAAD based on communal competition.&lt;/p&gt;'
