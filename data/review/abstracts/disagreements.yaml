    title: Privacy, Anonymity, and Perceived Risk in Open Collaboration
    publication_date: '2019-05-02'
    abstract: Anonymity can enable both healthy online interactions like support-seeking
      and toxic behaviors like hate speech. How do online service providers balance
      these threats and opportunities? This two-part qualitative study examines the
      challenges perceived by open collaboration service providers in allowing anonymous
      contributions to their projects. We interviewed eleven people familiar with organizational
      decisions related to privacy and security at five open collaboration projects
      and followed up with an analysis of public discussions about anonymous contribution
      to Wikipedia. We contrast our findings with prior work on threats perceived by
      project volunteers and explore misalignment between policies aiming to serve contributors
      and the privacy practices of contributors themselves.

    title: The potential of inclusive and collaborative Open Research processes at the
      science-policy interface
    publication_date: '2023-01-11'
    abstract: Proponents of Open Research often assert that it can support evidence-based
      policy-making by making scientific outputs more readily available to policy-makers
      and other policy actors, yet there is little empirical work to support or deny
      this claim. This paper fills this void by reporting the results of a qualitative
      study with researchers who regularly work at the science-policy interface. We
      found that there is little evidence that Open Research products, namely Open Access
      and open data, which aim at increasing access and transparency, are useful in
      integrating science into policy-making. Instead, we found that the cognitive accessibility
      of research outputs is more important than their physical accessibility, and that
      inclusive and collaborative Open Research processes, like upstream engagement,
      co-creation and Citizen Science, are most effective at doing so.

    title: Exploring Open Science Practices in Behavioural Public Policy Research
    publication_date: '2023-05-10'
    abstract: 'In their book `Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth and Happiness'',
      Thaler and Sunstein argue that choice architectures are promising public policy
      interventions. This research programme motivated the creation of so-called `nudge
      units'' which aim to apply insights from behavioural science to improve public
      policy. We take a close look at a meta-analysis of the evidence gathered by two
      of the largest and most influential nudge units using statistical techniques to
      detect reporting biases. We find evidence suggestive of selective reporting on
      the full dataset, although this pattern is not robust in subgroup analyses. We
      therefore additionally evaluate the public pre-analysis plans from the Office
      of Evaluation Sciences. We find that the analysis plans and reporting usually
      lack sufficient detail to evaluate (unintentional) reporting biases. Nevertheless,
      we identify several instances of excellent practice. We additionally highlight
      several improvements that would enhance the effectiveness of the pre-analysis
      plans and reports as a means to combat reporting biases. We believe our findings
      and suggestions can further improve the evidence base on which policy decisions
      are made.'

      in the Design Field'
    publication_date: '2019-03-01'
    abstract: The article explores the concept of “openness” in the design field. In
      particular, it suggests a broad interpretation of the relationship between “openness”
      and design by analyzing the use of the expression “open design” between 2000 and
      2017. This expression is related to words such as, co-design, crowdsourcing, open
      innovation, making and open manufacturing, which can be synthesized by the concepts
      of open source, collaboration, and access. The article finally expresses, through
      a critical point of view, the reasons why open processes in design have limitations.

    title: Collaboration and Open Science Initiatives in Primate Research
    publication_date: '2021-03-25'
    abstract: Traditionally, primate cognition research has been conducted by independent
      teams on small populations of a few species. Such limited variation and small
      sample sizes pose problems that prevent us from reconstructing the evolutionary
      history of primate cognition. In this chapter, we discuss how large-scale collaboration,
      a research model successfully implemented in other fields, makes it possible to
      obtain the large and diverse datasets needed to conduct robust comparative analysis
      of primate cognitive abilities. We discuss the advantages and challenges of large-scale
      collaborations and argue for the need for more open science practices in the field.
      We describe these collaborative projects in psychology and primatology and introduce
      ManyPrimates as the first, successful collaboration that has established an infrastructure
      for large-scale, inclusive research in primate cognition. Considering examples
      of large-scale collaborations both in primatology and psychology, we conclude
      that this type of research model in primate cognition.

    title: Reducing barriers to open science by standardizing practices and realigning
      incentives
    publication_date: '2022-07-12'
    abstract: Open science can accelerate the pace of research and contribute to a more
      equitable society. However, the current culture of scientific research is not
      optimally structured to promote extensive sharing of a range of outputs. In this
      policy position paper, we outline current open science practices and key bottlenecks
      in their broader adoption. We propose that national science agencies create a
      digital infrastructure framework that would standardize open science principles
      and make them actionable. We also suggest ways of redefining research success
      to align better with open science, and to incentivize a system where sharing various
      research outputs is beneficial to researchers.

    title: Knowledge and practices of open science among scholars and researchers in
      Tanzania
    publication_date: '2022-12-19'
    abstract: The Open Science (OS) movement has been spreading rapidly among researchers
      with positive outcomes on accessibility of scientific knowledge. However, there
      is no clear evidence on the level of awareness and types of OS practices among
      scholars and researchers in Tanzania, potentially missing an opportunity to reap
      the rewards of the movement to scholarly pursuits. This study investigated the
      level of awareness of OS and practices among Tanzanian scholars and researchers.
      Findings of a digital survey conducted for three months and recruited 144 respondents,
      show a high level of awareness of the term OS for 84% of respondents, most of
      them having encountered it from peers or online sources including social media.
      About 69% of respondents were male while about 44% of respondents were early career
      professionals. Open access (OA) publishing was the most common OS activity practised
      by respondents, highlighting both the need to create awareness on other practices
      and an entry point for knowledge expansion. However, respondents highlighted the
      barriers to spreading of the OS movement in the country including lack of awareness,
      knowledge and skills, the lack of institutional support and concerns over data
      security and ownership. Findings of this study establish OA as the most common
      and important OS practice among Tanzanian scholars. They show the importance of
      online resources and peers to peer learning and in spreading OS awareness. The
      study also reveals several areas of advocacy and including setting supportive
      institutional policies and building infrastructure to support OS practices. We
      recomment establisment of robust guidelines, institutional support and clear opportunities
      to incentivize individuals to adopt OS practices ao as to achieve the momentum
      required to scale the movement beyond OA.

      which is beginning to nest itself among other complementary services and form
      a network for open research that increases the collective resilience of aligned

    title: Reducing Barriers to Open Science by Standardizing Practices and Realigning

    publication_date: '2022-12-12'
    abstract: Open science, the practice of sharing findings and resources towards the
      collaborative pursuit of scientific progress and societal good, can accelerate
      the pace of research and contribute to a more equitable society. However, the
      current culture of scientific research is not optimally structured to promote
      extensive sharing of a range of outputs. In this policy position paper, we outline

    title: Open Communitition
    publication_date: '2021-11-13'
    abstract: '&lt;p&gt;The recent enthusiasm in popular culture for massively multiplayer
      online environments has proven that eclectic online communities have the potential
      to develop powerful problem solving capacities through the enactment of a collective
      intelligence. In collaborative design, this calls for the implementation of a
      shared environment leveraging the collective intelligence of online communities
      through open competition. The goal is to spur innovation through a public process
      where the emerging design ideas are available to all competitors. Foreseeing a
      radical change in the identity of the architect, becoming but the designer of
      these emergent communal design environments, this paper aims at making the case
      for this alternate CAAD model through the execution of a pilot study. This study,
      based on the Serpentine Pavilion procedural framework, sends a sample group of
      designers to a shared videogame environment, where they are asked to create their
      own pavilion using a kit of parts drawn from the reverse engineering of Frank
      Gehry’s 2008 pavilion. These iterations are scored in real time against a set
      of quantitative programmatic requirements, but they are also assessed qualitatively
      through more subjective criteria by the community of competitors, enriched by
      the immersive virtual experience of each other’s designs. Observation and analysis
      of participants has been undertaken through the recording of design sessions and
      online survey. This pilot study is currently being undertaken, yet the initial
      results hint at displaying much potential for a participative, intuitive and instantaneous
      form of collaborative CAAD based on communal competition.&lt;/p&gt;'

    title: (Why) Are Open Research Practices the Future for the Study of Language Learning?
    publication_date: '2023-02-27'
    abstract: Open Research practices are relevant to all stages of research, from conceptualisation
      through to dissemination. Here, we discuss key facets of Open Research, highlighting
      its rationales, infrastructures, behaviours, and challenges. Part I conceptualizes
      Open Research and its rationales. Part II identifies challenges, such as the speed
      and cost of Open Research; the usability of open data and materials; the difficulties
      of conducting replication research; and the economics and sustainability of open
      access and Open Research generally. In discussing these challenges, we seek to
      provide examples of good practice, describe and evaluate emerging innovations,
      and envision change. Part III considers ongoing co-evolutions of culture, infrastructure,
      and behaviours, and acknowledges the limitations of our review and of Open Research
      practices. We argue that Open Research is indeed a large part of our future, and
      most—if not all—challenges are surmountable, but doing so requires significant
      changes for many aspects of the research process.

    title: Accelerating addiction research via Open Science and Team Science
    publication_date: '2023-07-05'
    abstract: The replication crisis of the past decade has taught us that our literature
      is severely biased. Many empirical findings underlying our theories cannot be
      replicated. Although the extent of this problem in addiction science is largely
      unknown, given several factors we discuss in this chapter (e.g., publication bias),
      there is little reason to believe that replicability in addiction research is
      any better. Based on meta-science performed over the past decade, we propose that
      addiction researchers use Open Science and Team Science practices to improve the
      replicability of their work and thus reduce the bias in the literature and increase
      the credibility of our field. We walk the reader through six concrete steps necessary
      for successful implementation of Open Science and Team Science within the field
      of addiction research. These steps include, 1) preregister; 2) share data, code,
      and materials; 3) replicate; 4) train Open Science; 5) change the culture and
      incentivize Open Science; and 6) collaborate in large teams. We discuss evidence
      supporting the effectiveness of these practices and highlight some limitations
      and counterpoints to our proposal.

      to foster scientific progress'
    publication_date: '2022-03-30'
    abstract: This perspective article was written by invitation of the editors in chief
      as a summary and extension of the symposium entitled Psychoneuroendocrine Research
      in the Era of the Replication Crisis which was held at the virtual meeting of
      the International Society of Psychoneuroendocrinology 2021. It highlights the
      opportunities presented by the application of open and reproducible scientific
      practices in psychoneuroendocrinology (PNE), an interdisciplinary field at the
      intersection of psychology, endocrinology, immunology, neurology, and psychiatry.
      It conveys an introduction to the topics preregistration, registered reports,
      quantifying the impact of equally-well justifiable analysis decisions, and open
      data and scripts, while emphasizing ‘selfish’ reasons to adopt such practices
      as individual researcher. Complementary to the call for adoption of open science
      practices, we highlight the need for methodological best practice guidelines in
      the field of PNE, which could further contribute to enhancing replicability of
      results. We propose concrete steps for future actions and provide links to additional
      resources for those interested in adopting open and reproducible science practices
      in future studies.

    title: 'Promoting FAIR Data Through Community-driven Agile Design: the Open Data
      Commons for Spinal Cord Injury (odc-sci.org)'
    publication_date: '2021-08-04'
    abstract: The past decade has seen accelerating movement from data protectionism
      in publishing toward open data sharing to improve reproducibility and translation
      of biomedical research. Developing data sharing infrastructures to meet these
      new demands remains a challenge. One model for data sharing involves simply attaching
      data, irrespective of its type, to publisher websites or general use repositories.
      However, some argue this creates a 'data dump' that does not promote the goals
      of making data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR). Specialized
      data sharing communities offer an alternative model where data are curated by
      domain experts to make it both open and FAIR. We report on our experiences developing
      one such data-sharing ecosystem focusing on 'long-tail' preclinical data, the
      Open Data Commons for Spinal Cord Injury (odc-sci.org). ODC-SCI was developed
      with community-based agile design requirements directly pulled from a series of
      workshops with multiple stakeholders (researchers, consumers, non-profit funders,
      governmental agencies, journals, and industry members). ODC-SCI focuses on heterogeneous
      tabular data collected by preclinical researchers including bio-behaviour, histopathology
      findings and molecular endpoints. This has led to an example of a specialized
      neurocommons that is well-embraced by the community it aims to serve. In the present
      paper, we provide a review of the community-based design template and describe
      the adoption by the community including a high-level review of current data assets,
      publicly released datasets, and web analytics. Although odc-sci.org is in its
      late beta stage of development, it represents a successful example of a specialized
      data commons that may serve as a model for other fields.

    title: 'The State of Open Science Practices in Psychometric Studies of Suicide:
      A Systematic Review'
    publication_date: '2023-06-22'
    abstract: 'Background: The adoption of open science practices (OSPs) is crucial
      for promoting transparency and robustness in research. We conducted a systematic
      review to assess the frequency and trends of OSPs in psychometric studies focusing
      on measures of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Methods: We analyzed publications
      from two international databases, examining the use of OSPs such as open access
      publication, preregistration, provision of open materials, and data sharing. The
      data were further analyzed based on publication year, first author''s region of
      affiliation, and publication type (open access vs. restricted access). Results:
      Our findings indicate a lack of adherence to OSPs in psychometric studies of suicide.
      The majority of manuscripts were published under restricted access, and preregistrations
      were not utilized. The provision of open materials and data was rare, with limited
      access to instruments and analysis scripts. Open access versions (preprints/postprints)
      were scarce. Trends analysis showed inconsistent changes over the years, with
      regional variations in open access publication. Conclusions: The low adoption
      of OSPs in psychometric studies of suicide calls for urgent action. Researchers
      must prioritize the use of preregistration, publication of preprints/postprints,
      and providing access to materials and data. Embracing a culture of open science
      will enhance transparency, reproducibility, and the impact of research in suicide
      prevention efforts.'
