    title: Collaboration and Open Science Initiatives in Primate Research
    publication_date: '2021-03-25'
    abstract: Traditionally, primate cognition research has been conducted by independent
      teams on small populations of a few species. Such limited variation and small
      sample sizes pose problems that prevent us from reconstructing the evolutionary
      history of primate cognition. In this chapter, we discuss how large-scale collaboration,
      a research model successfully implemented in other fields, makes it possible to
      obtain the large and diverse datasets needed to conduct robust comparative analysis
      of primate cognitive abilities. We discuss the advantages and challenges of large-scale
      collaborations and argue for the need for more open science practices in the field.
      We describe these collaborative projects in psychology and primatology and introduce
      ManyPrimates as the first, successful collaboration that has established an infrastructure
      for large-scale, inclusive research in primate cognition. Considering examples
      of large-scale collaborations both in primatology and psychology, we conclude
      that this type of research model in primate cognition.

    title: Accelerating addiction research via Open Science and Team Science
    publication_date: '2023-07-05'
    abstract: The replication crisis of the past decade has taught us that our literature
      is severely biased. Many empirical findings underlying our theories cannot be
      replicated. Although the extent of this problem in addiction science is largely
      unknown, given several factors we discuss in this chapter (e.g., publication bias),
      there is little reason to believe that replicability in addiction research is
      any better. Based on meta-science performed over the past decade, we propose that
      addiction researchers use Open Science and Team Science practices to improve the
      replicability of their work and thus reduce the bias in the literature and increase
      the credibility of our field. We walk the reader through six concrete steps necessary
      for successful implementation of Open Science and Team Science within the field
      of addiction research. These steps include, 1) preregister; 2) share data, code,
      and materials; 3) replicate; 4) train Open Science; 5) change the culture and
      incentivize Open Science; and 6) collaborate in large teams. We discuss evidence
      supporting the effectiveness of these practices and highlight some limitations
      and counterpoints to our proposal.

    title: 'Promoting FAIR Data Through Community-driven Agile Design: the Open Data
      Commons for Spinal Cord Injury (odc-sci.org)'
    publication_date: '2021-08-04'
    abstract: The past decade has seen accelerating movement from data protectionism
      in publishing toward open data sharing to improve reproducibility and translation
      of biomedical research. Developing data sharing infrastructures to meet these
      new demands remains a challenge. One model for data sharing involves simply attaching
      data, irrespective of its type, to publisher websites or general use repositories.
      However, some argue this creates a 'data dump' that does not promote the goals
      of making data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR). Specialized
      data sharing communities offer an alternative model where data are curated by
      domain experts to make it both open and FAIR. We report on our experiences developing
      one such data-sharing ecosystem focusing on 'long-tail' preclinical data, the
      Open Data Commons for Spinal Cord Injury (odc-sci.org). ODC-SCI was developed
      with community-based agile design requirements directly pulled from a series of
      workshops with multiple stakeholders (researchers, consumers, non-profit funders,
      governmental agencies, journals, and industry members). ODC-SCI focuses on heterogeneous
      tabular data collected by preclinical researchers including bio-behaviour, histopathology
      findings and molecular endpoints. This has led to an example of a specialized
      neurocommons that is well-embraced by the community it aims to serve. In the present
      paper, we provide a review of the community-based design template and describe
      the adoption by the community including a high-level review of current data assets,
      publicly released datasets, and web analytics. Although odc-sci.org is in its
      late beta stage of development, it represents a successful example of a specialized
      data commons that may serve as a model for other fields.
