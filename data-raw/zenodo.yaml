  title: 'Open Science by Default: a FOSTER Approach'
  description: |-
    <p>The European Commission has described RRI as a framework consisting of six key pillars: Engagement (science and society), Gender Equality, Science Education (knowledge and tools for future researchers and other societal actors), Open Access (publications and data), Ethic (codes of conduct, transparency), Governance (responsibility, trustiness and compliance).</p>

    <p>Open Science is based on these principles: open methodology, open data, open software, open access, open peer review and open educational resources. Both concepts rely on collaboration among different stakeholders, ethical principles governing science, best practices to share and collaborate in science, and&nbsp;science accessible to citizens, among others.</p>

    <p>FOSTER (Facilitate Open Science Training for European Research) is an EC funded project under the 7<sup>th</sup> Framework Program that aims to Integrate open science principles and practice in the current research workflow, and support especially young researcher to adopt those practices.</p>

    <p>In order to achieve these objectives, FOSTER has implemented different learning and dissemination approaches: face to face training activities, free online courses, workshops and seminars. The results lead to conclude there is <em>no</em> one-size-<em>fits</em>-all <em>solution: audience, culture, disciplines, societies must be taken into account to embrace RRI and open science principles. This communication presents some of the results of FOSTER project related to their training activities, </em>based on 2 years of intensive training of all stakeholders in the research ecosystem.</p>

  title: 'Requesting Crowd Expertise: The SSH Open Marketplace and LIBER'
  description: |-
    <p>SSHOC is the Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) component of the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC). This SSH contribution will provide access to flexible and scalable data as well as relevant and community-driven services via coordinated adaptation of Open Science and FAIR principles across SSH domains. At the core of SSHOC&rsquo;s contribution is the SSH Open Marketplace: a discovery portal for a rich variety of resources presented in a contextualized way.</p>

    <p>The SSH Open Marketplace aspires to achieve tight-knit integration into existing communities of practice in SSH. LIBER, as a community of experts in information practices of the research environment, is an important partner to leverage synergies for the benefit of SSH researchers and Open Knowledge. We see libraries as strategic partners, because information practices and resources in the SSH research environment belong to the core of the SSH Open Marketplace&rsquo;s mission, just as they do for many libraries and information infrastructures. Building on the dynamic started at the LIBER Conference 2019 (SSHOC: What&rsquo;s in it for research libraries?), we hope to use this poster to continue the discussion with you on the concepts, ideas or best practices implemented by LIBER communities.</p>

    <p>Connecting to the extensive network of LIBER, we want to suggest two angles of mutual exchange, the first one focusing on the social and communicative aspect, the second one aiming at the technological/ information-science aspect of the SSH Open Marketplace:</p>

    <p>1. Community-driven curation approach: The SSH Open Marketplace can partly be conceived of as a social infrastructure. This aspect is best expressed by its community-based curation. Three pillars underlie the data population and enrichment of the marketplace&rsquo;s content: automatic ingestion and updating of data sources; continuous curation of the information by the editorial team and - most importantly - contributions from its users, the SSH community. At release of the final version, we want to say that the marketplace&rsquo;s content and particularly its contextualisation is the result of collaborative work, characterised by a user-centric view. At the heart of SSH Open Marketplace are features that foster contributions, feedback and comments because they ensure that the portal mirrors real research practices. What are best practices based on your experience? Would you like to join the editorial team?</p>

    <p>2. Technology and information-science inspiration: Success for an information discovery portal like the SSH Open Marketplace boils down to its uptake by the targeted audience. But what can technology and information-science provide as inspiration, best-practices, do&rsquo;s and don&rsquo;ts? The SSH Open Marketplace relies in large part on harvesting and harmonising records from third-parties like TaPoR, CLARIN, or DARIAH. Looking at the rich experience of libraries in collecting, structuring, enriching and exposing information, we want to hear your feedback regarding our current approach, ideas we may have overlooked or best-practices, and we also want to show you how the Marketplace could support research libraries work. How can we refine our approach to better meet yours and researchers&rsquo; needs? And what can you gain using the SSH Open Marketplace to support SSH researchers in your libraries?</p>

  title: 'French Second National Plan for Open Science: Support and Opportunities
    for Universities'' Open Infrastructures and Practices.'
  description: |-
    <p>The French second National Plan for Open Science was launched in July 2021 and will run through 2024. Through 4 lines of action, the plan seeks to foster open science practices, to make science more effective, more transparent and more accessible, and to contribute to the EU goal of promoting open science. Its funding, which amounts to &euro;15 million per year, will further facilitate the dissemination and sharing of publications, research data and codes produced in France, as well as increasing open research practices among research units and universities.</p>

    <p><br>
    This second national plan includes research source codes, provides a framework for actions in fostering data openness and sharing, for example through the creation of the national repository for research data. The plan multiplies the transformational levers for spreading open science practices among various disciplines. It is strongly oriented towards Europe and proposes, in the context of the French presidency of the European Union, that open science practices be efficiently taken into account in individual and collective research evaluations.</p>

    <p><br>
    The 4 action lines are the following:<br>
    1. Generalise open access to scientific publications;<br>
    2. Structuring, sharing and opening up research data;<br>
    3. Open and promote source codes produced by research;<br>
    4. Transform practices to make open science the default principle.</p>

    <p><br>
    We focus on a double opportunity that this plan offers to French universities: the possibility of relying on a national policy framework to advance their own policies, infrastructures and practices on the one hand, and the implementation of cooperation between universities to improve systems and their visibility at international level on the other.</p>

    <p><br>
    The first use case relates to the national research data repository, Recherche Data Gouv, which will be available in the first quarter of 2022. It aims to structure research data and make them openly available. We take the example of data.sciencespo, Sciences Po&#39;s institutional repository, to show how it will be integrated into Research Data Gouv and will benefit from complementary national initiatives to support researchers and university support staff in adopting open data practices.</p>

    <p><br>
    The second use case concerns the 4th action line, and more precisely its measure n&deg;10, whose objective is to develop the open science skills of students and support staff throughout their career. The example of the University of Strasbourg shows how this national impetus makes it possible to strengthen the cooperation already established within EUCOR-the European Campus with German (Karlsruher Institut f&uuml;r Technologie, Albert-Ludwigs Universit&auml;t Freiburg) and Swiss (Universit&auml;t Basel) partners to train support staff and doctoral students in research data management. Workshops for the exchange of practices bringing together the support teams are organised on a regular basis and a training offer shared between the partners is implemented for the doctoral students of the EUCOR programmes.</p>

  title: 'The Open Innovation in Science research field: a collaborative conceptualisation
    approach'
  description: <p>Openness and collaboration in scientific research are attracting
    increasing attention from scholars and practitioners alike. However, a common
    understanding of these phenomena is hindered by disciplinary boundaries and disconnected
    research streams. We link dispersed knowledge on Open Innovation, Open Science,
    and related concepts such as Responsible Research and Innovation by proposing
    a unifying Open Innovation in Science (OIS) Research Framework. This framework
    captures the antecedents, contingencies, and consequences of open and collaborative
    practices along the entire process of generating and disseminating scientific
    insights and translating them into innovation. Moreover, it elucidates individual-,
    team-, organisation-, field-, and society-level factors shaping OIS practices.
    To conceptualise the framework, we employed a collaborative approach involving
    47 scholars from multiple disciplines, highlighting both tensions and commonalities
    between existing approaches. The OIS Research Framework thus serves as a basis
    for future research, informs policy discussions, and provides guidance to scientists
    and practitioners</p>

  title: Open Science in Lattice Gauge Theory community
  description: |-
    <p>Talk presented at the the 39th&nbsp;International Symposium on Lattice Field Theory by Andreas Athenodorou, based on the &quot;Survey on lattice data analysis, presentation, and curation practices&quot;, the results of which can be found in&nbsp;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6980070</p>

    <p>Abstract:&nbsp;Open science aims to make scientific research processes, tools and results accessible to all scientific communities, creating trust in science and enabling digital competences to be realized in research, leading to increased innovation. It provides standard and transparent pathways to conducting research and fosters best practices for collecting, analysing, preserving, sharing and reusing data, software, workflows and other outputs through collaborative networks. Open Science appears to becoming the norm with its applications spanning throughout the whole research cycle of a project. The importance of making Open Science a reality is reflected in the policy and implementation actions of the European Commission incorporated in research and innovation funding programmes (FP7, Horizon 2020, Horizon Europe) and the development of the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) as it improves the quality, efficiency and responsiveness of research. EOSC will enable researchers across disciplines and countries to store, curate and share data under a common policy framework with rules of participation and pre-defined set of technical specifications that are expected to help shape the &ldquo;Internet of FAIR data and services&rdquo; in Europe. In this talk we will present the basic Open Science principles explaining briefly best practices for materialising open science. Subsequently, we will present the results of the landscaping survey of Open Science in the Lattice Gauge Theories community (https://latticesurvey.hpcf.cyi.ac.cy/index.php/157898). Finally, we will provide directions in which the LGT community could move in order to enhance Openness and FAIRness (Finability, Accessibility, Interoperability, Reusability) in Science.</p>

  title: Reflecting Open Practices on Digital Infrastructures
  description: |-
    <p>In academia, science is always interwoven with education. Thus, open education has to be an important component of open science. While earlier concepts of open practices emphasized the use and creation of open educational resources (OER), current models of open educational practices (OEP) aim to frame concepts of openness in learning and teaching. Researchers have been investigating the meaning of openness and its diverse interpretations with respect to aspects of open pedagogy (Wiley &amp; Hilton III, 2018), empowerment, inclusion, and social justice (Koseoglu et al., 2020). In Germany a newer media didactical discourse proposes to enrich the debate of OER infrastructure with concepts of OEP (Bellinger &amp; Mayrberger, 2019).</p>

    <p>Open infrastructures, services and tools are not only part of open science initiatives but as digital objects they influence the knowledge and practices of their users. Thus, they shape the way we are able to practice openness. Our research therefore draws upon current functionalities of higher education services that provide open learning and teaching resources. We asked: How might open educational practices be shaped by current functions in digital services for learning and teaching resources? To answer this question, we investigated 38 German, Austrian and Swiss higher education services providing open learning and teaching material (e.g., OER repositories, learning management systems, video platforms, publication servers). We examined the functions of those services with regard to conceptual ideas discussed on OER and OEP (Santos-Hermosa et al., 2017; Zervas et al., 2014). We<br>
    identified diverse core functions of current services that we will discuss regarding the needs of users who want to adapt OEP. Infrastructures do not only allow the reuse and sharing of OER, but also convey the model of open educational resources in their media performance. It is striking that current services concentrate on the searching and finding of open educational resources, but lack the idea of open collaboration and communication between teachers and learners.</p>

    <p>Our poster contributes to how infrastructures can better support OEP and lead to a better use and acceptance of OER among scientific communities. It provides useful insights for the open science community into how to develop infrastructures that foster open educational practices.</p>

  description: |-
    <p><em><strong>Slides from Kirstie&#39;s talk for the WHO Expert Panel on ethical programming for AI in health care&nbsp;on 14 May 2020</strong></em></p>

    <p><strong>Abstract</strong>: All members of the Alan Turing Institute, the UK&#39;s national institute for data science and artificial intelligence, are guided by the Turing&#39;s &quot;Rules of the Game&quot;. There are six dimensions of these recommendations for supportive interactions:&nbsp;<em>trust, transparency, inclusivity, integrity, respect,</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>leadership</em>. In this talk, I describe how the Turing&#39;s Tools, Practices and Systems (TPS) Research Programme empowers humans to embed these values into our ways of working, and the open source software and infrastructure we build and maintain.<em>Trustworthy systems</em>&nbsp;allow researchers to implement innovative analytic methods safely. All members of the health data science ecosystem require training and better support for&nbsp;<em>transparent reporting</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>inclusive interoperable standards</em>. As a sector, we must go beyond legal compliance to deep and continuous engagement in&nbsp;<em>ethical research integrity</em>. We need safe people designing and building our AI infrastructure, and we must&nbsp;<em>respect</em>&nbsp;the expertise of patients, clinicians and HIC designers in that process. And finally, there is an opportunity for health data science to&nbsp;<em>incentivise leadership</em>&nbsp;in open ways of working, rather than waiting to follow what has been done before.</p>

    <p><strong>Bio</strong>: Kirstie Whitaker leads the Tools, Practices and Systems Research Programme at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.turing.ac.uk/">The Alan Turing Institute</a>&nbsp;(London, UK). Her work covers a broad range of interests and methods, but the driving principle is to improve the lives of neurodivergent people and people with mental health conditions. Dr Whitaker uses magnetic resonance imaging to study child and adolescent brain development and participatory citizen science to educate non-autistic people about how they can better support autistic friends and colleagues. She is the lead developer of&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way"><em>The Turing Way</em></a>, an openly developed educational resource to enable more reproducible data science. Kirstie is a passionate advocate for making science &quot;open for all&quot; by promoting equity and inclusion for people from diverse backgrounds, and by changing the academic incentive structure to reward collaborative working.

  title: Open Science Toolbox for Animal Research
  description: |-
    <p>Open science has become a buzzword in the scientific community that too often misses the practical application for individual researchers. Transparent sharing of research results maximizes their utility and accelerate scientific progress. Open science practices support collaborations and improve communication between science and society.</p>

    <p>The Open Science Toolbox for Animal Research was created by the Bf3R to provide an overview of open science tools that can be applied throughout the research process, from designing and conducting experiments to analyzing data and publishing results.</p>

    <p>The tools listed in the table were selected based on their relevance to the animal research community in terms of their intended function to improve transparency and reproducibility. Inclusion of a tool does not imply endorsement by Bf3R, and exclusion of a tool is based solely on relevance; no assessments of tool quality were made or considered in the development of the Open Science Toolbox.</p>

    <p>We will follow the future developments of open science tools that are suitable for animal research and regularly update this toolbox. If you wish to suggest additional tools that should be added to the list, please email us at: <a href="mailto:OS-toolbox@bfr.bund.de">OS-toolbox@bfr.bund.de</a>.</p>

    <p><strong>About the workshop</strong></p>

    <p>NWO introduced the <a href="https://www.nwo.nl/en/researchprogrammes/open-science/open-science-fund">Open Science Fund</a> as a funding instrument designed to reward and incentivise researchers who practice open science. Many of the <a href="https://www.nwo.nl/en/news/26-projects-stimulate-open-science">awarded projects in the 2020/2021</a> round rely on a collaborative approach that leverages the strengths and expertise of professionals trained in different fields and disciplines &ndash; in other words, a team science approach. The quality and strength of the team was part of the grant assessment criteria, as was the open science track record of the main applicant.&nbsp;Taking three of the awarded projects as examples, the workshop&nbsp;looked at best practices for team work and collaboration and discussed how to reward and recognise such practices.</p>

  title: D5.4 Roadmap and guidelines to promote Open Science in transport research
  description: |-
    <p>Deliverable 5.4 &ndash; Roadmap and guidelines to promote Open Science in Transport Research encompasses the vision of the community of Open Science in transport research and the strategy and framework conditions towards fulfilling the vision by 2030. In 2030, Open Science is a reality in transport research, the TOPOS Observatory has been already developed and is being used. TOPOS observatory is recognized as the Open Science platform for transport research that supports the transformation of mobility towards safety, security, decarbonisation, openness, inclusivity and seamlessness of journeys.</p>

    <p>The document describes the challenges (i.e. technical interoperability, data and information interoperability, deploying of new skills, new schemes for research evaluation and collaborative ways of working, privacy and legal issues) between the future vision and the status quo, the planned milestones and recommended action as well as guidelines and principles to promote the required cultural shift towards Open Science. The EOSC Strategic Research and Innovation agenda sets the framework for necessary skills, fundamental principles and infrastructure to promote Open Science in Europe until 2027. Since the coordination and support action BE OPEN is acting in close collaboration with the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) Partnership, it harmonized its milestones with the given timeframe of the EOSC Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda and relates to the goals Strategic Transport Research and Innovation Agenda for air‐, road‐, rail and maritime and cross‐modal transport towards clean, competitive and connected mobility.</p>

    <p>The milestones are aligned in four steps, from connecting the community and establishing the TOPOS Observatory and Forum (2021), up‐taking the practice of Open Science in transport research in research organisations and academia (2023), embracing collaboration with citizens, industry, authorities to achieve Open innovation for required transport solutions (2025), to the internationalisation of the community, principles, standards and practices ((2027) in order to support the global transformation of mobility towards decarbonisation, safety and security and inclusive mobility that serves the people and the planet until 2030.</p>

    <p>The roadmap offers recommendations along Key Success Factors, mainly focussing on the training and education, and the dissemination of principles and practical aspects through the promotors for the entire community (academia, researchers, research organisations, authorities, NGOs, citizens, and many more), standardization of data, provision of resources and capacities to conduct Open Science as well as effective incentives to trigger a cultural shift to share‐re‐use‐ and reproduce research, build‐ up of security measures, development and innovation in open infrastructures and methods. Finally, the coordination, support and accompanying research is suggested alongside the uptake of Open Science in transport research to constantly learn and improve practices and assess its impacts in order to be able to adapt strategies.</p>

    <p>The document is set up, typically for roadmaps, to work as a living document that can be updated through the growing community regularly in order to react to new developments influencing Open Science practice in Europe.</p>

  title: Dataverse Network and Open Journal Systems Project to Encourage Data Sharing
    and Citation in Academic Journals
  description: As data sharing technology and data management practices have developed
    over the past decade, academic journals have come under pressure to disseminate
    the data associated with published articles. Harvard University's Institute for
    Quantitative Social Science (IQSS) recently received a two year grant from The
    Alfred P. Sloan Foundation to partner with Stanford University's Public Knowledge
    Project (PKP) in order to help make data sharing and preservation an intrinsic
    part of the scholarly publication process, and create awareness specifically among
    journal editors and publishers. This presentation will provide an overview of
    the collaboration between PKP's Open Journal Systems (OJS), and IQSS's Dataverse
    Network (DVN) team who are currently working on building the needed technology
    that will support seamless publication of research data and articles together;
    and to support new forms of social science data, readership and analysis. The
    immediate impact of the project will be to increase the number of readily replicable
    articles published, and the number of social science journals that adopt best
    data management and citation practices. The broadest impacts of the project will
    be to increase the pace of discovery in the social sciences, and to broaden the
    research opportunities for younger scholars.

  title: Open Science and the Data Stewardship Programme at Delft University of Technology
  description: |-
    <p>The principles of Open Science allow for rapid dissemination of knowledge, stimulate collaboration, and improve the reproducibility and quality of research. The transition to Open Science is an endeavour in which researchers require assistance.</p>

    <p>Delft University of Technology (TU Delft) in the Netherlands offers support in the form of policies and guidelines which facilitate the transition to Open Science. The Strategic Framework 2018-2024 of the TU Delft, entitled &ldquo;Impact for a better society&rdquo;, lists &ldquo;openness&rdquo; as one of the four major guiding principles. TU Delft has an Open Access Policy in place since 2016 and a Research Data Policy Framework since 2018. The TU Delft Library collaborates with the faculties of the university, IT support, as well as the valorisation and legal team to support researchers that have to adhere to these policies.</p>

    <p>Good Research Data Management (RDM) practises are a prerequisite for Open Science. By managing research data according to the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable) principles, the research process will become more transparent, efficient, and reproducible. To improve and support the RDM practises of researchers at TU Delft the Data Stewardship programme started in 2017. The Data Stewardship programme is centrally coordinated by the TU Delft Library and addresses discipline specific needs by embedding a Data Steward within each faculty of the university. The Data Steward is a &lsquo;one-stop-shop&rsquo; for researchers, able to answer questions regarding RDM and provide relevant high-quality support, or direct researchers to legal, ICT and IP experts. Data Stewards collaborate with Data Champions, disciplinary specific experts on RDM. The Data Stewardship programme aims to achieve a bottom-up approach required for the desired cultural change.</p>

    <p>Researchers are also supported by the TU Delft Library which provides Open Science guides and workshops/courses, as well as an Open Access fund to pay for the costs of publications in journals registered in the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ). Alternatively, researchers can make use of the TU Delft Open publishing platform, which publishes research Open Access. TU Delft also hosts an Open Access Data Archive, &lsquo;4TU.ResearchData&rsquo; and is a founding member of DataCite. In 2018 TU Delft launched a MOOC called &lsquo;Open Science: Sharing Your Research with the World&rsquo;. The Data Stewards inform researchers about these Open Science developments and encourage the use of the facilities that TU Delft offers.</p>

    <p>The Data Stewardship programme and Open Science facilities at the TU Delft are used as a case study to illustrate the challenges and opportunities that libraries face in the transition to Open Science at research institutions.</p>

  title: DIY Open Science Collaboration. How to make the most of your [sustainability
    research] dream team
  description: |-
    <p>Species know no boundaries, and to solve thorny environmental problems you need a great variety of expertise and skill sets that do not exist in one person or even one place.&nbsp; As researchers, we build teams that include multiple disciplines, multiple languages, (potentially) multiple funders, and definitely different points of view. Building the team can seem challenging, but in truth the actual challenge is making sure everyone feels welcome and able to contribute.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Teams that are good at communication and collaboration have developed practices that support an open science environment. These practices need to be put into place as a foundation when the team is forming, setting common expectations and tools. Teams with members from different countries and continents have additional considerations. These include the need to manage time zones, languages, and access to common tools.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>In this workshop we will use a workflow that can be applied to most research scenarios to enable an international, interdisciplinary team to establish the practices and tools needed for optimal opportunity to collaborate and contribute to the scientific question at hand.&nbsp; In short, this is a &ldquo;do-it-yourself&rdquo; (DIY) collaboration primer.</p>

  title: Ten arguments against open science that you can win.
  description: |-
    <p><strong>About the speaker:&nbsp;</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Dr Malvika Sharan:&nbsp;</strong><em>The Alan Turing Institute, The Turing Way project, United Kingdom</em></p>

    <p>Malvika Sharan is the community manager of The Turing Way at The Alan Turing Institute. The Turing Way is an open-source and collaborative book project and Malvika works with its diverse community of researchers, educators, funders and other stakeholders to develop resources and ways to make data science reproducible, ethical, collaborative and inclusive for a wider community. After receiving her PhD in Bioinformatics, she worked at European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Germany, as a community coordinator that helped her solidify her values as an Open Researcher and community builder. She is a co-founder of the Open Life Science mentoring and training program that teaches and mentors researchers from all around the world to design, lead and sustain Open Science projects. She is a fellow of the Software Sustainability Institute, and a board member of Open Bioinformatics Foundation, where she focuses on training resources and fellowship programs to enhance the representation of marginalised groups in data science and bioinformatics.</p>

    <p><strong>About the talk:&nbsp;</strong></p>

    <p>Open Science invites all researchers to share their work, data, and research components openly so that others can read, reuse, reproduce, build upon and share them. Particularly in computational research and software development projects, open source principles are promoted as good practices. However, it is important to acknowledge that Open Science practices, communities and culture possess inherent systemic barriers that exist in science at large. Furthermore, applying open and inclusive methods to all our (research) work requires time, intention, resources and collaboration, which can be overwhelming, and in some cases impossible, for many. Therefore, if you are building an Open Science community and care about inclusiveness and accessibility like me, you might want to be prepared to respond to the arguments that may come up when advocating for Open Science. In my talk, I will share a few common arguments that I have come across (and experienced first hand) and what we as open science practitioners can do while committing to being an ally and make our workplace and communities more inclusive.</p>

  title: Can we reimagine FAIR for building communities in open science?
  description: |-
    <p><em>This keynotes talk was given by Malvika Sharan at <a href="https://www.opensciencefair.eu/">OPEN SCIENCE FAIR 2021 on 21 September 2021</a>. Video is available online on <a href="https://youtu.be/f960OXPzQO4?t=297.">YouTube.</a></em></p>

    <p>Different stakeholders in research contribute to open science communities with a shared mission of making scientific knowledge freely available for public access. However, most of these communities operate independently of other initiatives, either lacking the capacity to build meaningful collaboration or competing for limited resources. This often results in scientific outputs that most users can find, but not access, build upon or reuse in their local contexts. In this talk, I invite you to reimagine if FAIR [1] guiding principles can be applied for building and supporting open science communities. Can this practice be extended for cross-community collaboration, knowledge exchange and sharing resources? I will discuss how intentional connections between community-led efforts benefit the larger open science ecosystem by enabling sustainable development, maintenance and reuse of community resources. Bringing examples from my work in The Turing Way, Open Life Science and other initiatives, I will further highlight the irreplaceable importance of &lsquo;people in open infrastructure&rsquo; &mdash; those who facilitate FAIRness through inclusive approaches in open science communities.</p>

    <p>[1] FAIR principles provide guidelines to improve the Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reuse of digital assets. See FAIR Principles - GO FAIR: <a href="https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles.">https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles. </a></p>

  title: 'EUDAT-B2FIND : A FAIR friendly and interdisciplinary discovery service for
    open research data'
  description: |-
    The European Data Infrastructure (EUDAT) project established a pan-European e-infrastructure supporting

    a variety of multiple research communities and individuals to manage the rising tide of research data in

    open science. This Collaborative Data Infrastructure (CDI) is based on the FAIR principles and implements

    community-driven and advanced data management technologies and services to tackle the specific

    challenges of international and cross-domain research data management.

    The EUDAT data metadata service B2FIND plays a central role in the European Open Science Cloud (EOSChub)

    project as the central metadata repository and discovery portal for the diverse metadata collected

    from heterogeneous and interdisciplinary sources within and beyond EOSC-hub. The B2FIND catalogue not

    only harvests metadata from research communities, but also data from generic repositories, such as the

    data publication service EUDAT-B2SHARE.

    To support Open Science according to the FAIR principles, EUDAT-B2FIND allows both research data

    providers to easily publish their metadata and scientists to conduct cross-disciplinary and semantic search

    for and re-use of data resources.

  title: 'Blue-Cloud: Demonstrating the potential of Open Science for the ocean through
    a thematic EOSC'
  description: |-
    <p>Blue-Cloud is the thematic EOSC for the marine domain supporting FAIR and Open Science by developing a web-based environment that will provide scientists &amp; researchers with enhanced analytical capabilities and cloud-computing resources, underpinned by simplified access to a wealth of multidisciplinary and interoperable marine data services.<br>
    The project builds on existing European marine data infrastructures and e-infrastructures federating their services within the Blue-Cloud framework, enabling researchers to find, access, share, combine and reuse quality data across disciplines and countries.<br>
    The federation is taking place at the levels of (meta)data resources, computing resources and analytical service resources, driven by collaboration across research, data and e-infrastructures. A Blue-Cloud Data Discovery and Access Service (DDAS) is being developed to facilitate access to multi-disciplinary datasets. A Blue Cloud-Virtual Research Environment (VRE) has been established to enable collaborative research, allowing users to share analytical processes and resulting outputs, including data products and services for specific applications.<br>
    This innovation potential is explored and unlocked by five real-life demonstrators addressing societal challenges in the domains of genomics, fishery, aquaculture, biodiversity and environment. The demonstrators are showcasing how Blue-Cloud can enhance collaborative research in support of the EU Green Deal and key international initiatives, such as the United Nations Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development.<br>
    In addition, Blue-Cloud is developing a Strategic Roadmap to 2030 in collaboration with the wider marine science &amp; research community, as a policy document guiding the evolution of Blue-Cloud into the future aligning with wider developments, such as EOSC and initiatives related to the EU Digital Strategy e.g. the pilot Digital Twin of the Ocean and Destination Earth.<br>
    The presentation describes the vision and overarching technical framework of Blue-Cloud and the project&rsquo;s role in supporting EOSC and the uptake of Open Science principles across the marine research community.</p>

  title: 'FOSTER Project Workshop: Open Science at the Core of Libraries'
  description: |-
    <p>Libraries have gone a long way to facilitating research workflows, and more recently on fostering open access to science and openness in a broader sense. Science is evolving, research practices, resources and tools are opening up and going beyond a publication-based model to a new open environment of research data and digital research tools, social media and collaborative platforms. There is a compelling need for libraries&rsquo; practices to encompass these changes. The challenge is not only technological but also cultural and attitudinal and requires a clear effort to engage and develop the necessary skills and knowledge involved in this open science environment.</p>

    <p>This workshop is addressed to librarians at different levels and positions who are committed to supporting researchers and their research processes at their institutions, and would like to gain an understanding of the implications of open science for them, the potential opportunities and possible challenges, and check on existing best practices to deal with them.</p>

    <p>Participants may choose whether they would like to engage with the mentioned topics in advance or use the workshop as their starting point. A specially-designed FOSTER online course will provide introduction and background reading (flipped classroom setting) in the period leading up to the LIBER Annual Conference. The workshop itself will concentrate on key topics on open science from the libraries&rsquo; perspective. Interactive sessions will encourage discussion and the sharing of experiences of success and challenges among participants.</p>

    <p>An ultimate goal of this workshop is to provide participants with a set of tools and resources from the FOSTER portal. The workshop will be followed up with online materials and self-assessment methods. Equipped with this, participants may replicate the training and multiply the impact at their institutions targeting &nbsp;their peers, decision-makers or end-users.</p>

  title: '[14] The engagement component for a successful pan-European Open Science
    infrastructure: shaping discourse and engaging stakeholders from a research libraries
    perspective'
  description: "<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;Research libraries have been active
    participants in developing services and support towards fulfilling the promise
    of Open Science. With their expertise in scholarly communication, data management
    and long-term digital stewardship they have been empowering researchers with technical
    infrastructure and training to enable open access to research outputs, to support
    their reuse, and promote more transparent and reproducible research processes.</p>\n\n<p>Still,
    for the Open Science agenda to be fully realized, and to avoid duplication of
    efforts, a stronger coordination is required: one that would support infrastructure
    interoperability, shared policies, and sustainable initiatives. Building on these
    principles, and recognizing the issues at stake, the EU has launched the European
    Open Science Cloud (EOSC), an initiative to accelerate and support more effective
    Open Science and Open Innovation endeavors at the pan-European level. When realized,
    EOSC will include &ldquo;the required human expertise, resources, standards, best
    practices as well as the underpinning technical infrastructures&rdquo; in order
    to enable &ldquo;trusted access to services, systems and the re-use of shared
    scientific data across disciplinary, social and geographical borders&rdquo;. To
    realize such a seamless network of services at the European level, and to support
    a shared commons for research outputs, a broad variety of stakeholders needs to
    be engaged. These include, among others, scientific communities, service providers,
    infrastructure initiatives, and funding agencies and policy makers.</p>\n\n<p>With
    input from the LIBER&rsquo;s participation in the European Open Science Cloud
    for Research pilot (EOSCpilot) project &mdash;one of the first collaborative project
    funded under the EOSC&mdash; this paper will discuss:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>effective
    strategies for stakeholder identification and engagement;</li>\n\t<li>practical
    approaches to leverage already existing engagement channels, and to establish
    new ones;</li>\n\t<li>the essential role of research libraries in the process.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>With
    their expertise, and inherent experience as liaisons, research libraries can play
    a pivotal role in shaping the discourse and engaging stakeholders around the Open
    Science agenda and be primary partners in realizing a pan-European infrastructure
    powering (open) sustainable knowledge in the digital age.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Bio:</strong>&nbsp;Simone

  title: Enabling Open Science practices in Helmholtz!
  description: |-
    <p>The Helmholtz Open Science Office (OS Office) embraces this mission since it was founded by the Helmholtz Association in 2005. It supports the Helmholtz Association as a service provider in shaping the cultural change towards open science. Furthermore, it promotes dialogue on open science within and beyond Helmholtz and regularly offers events on open science developments to provide impulses and guidelines for the Helmholtz Association.</p>

    <p>In the area of open research data, the Helmholtz Open Science Office supports the Helmholtz Centers in developing policies and implementing corresponding practices for handling digital research data. Furthermore, the OS Office supports the discussion on the re-use and thus also reproducibility of research data in Helmholtz and the interdisciplinary exchange in this field.</p>

    <p>The <a href="https://www.nfdi.de/en-gb">National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI)</a> and the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/research-and-innovation/strategy/strategy-2020-2024/our-digital-future/open-science/european-open-science-cloud-eosc_en">European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) </a>represent central infrastructures in this context. Numerous NFDI consortia are being implemented with substantial Helmholtz participation, and Helmholtz Centers are also actively involved in the implementation of the EOSC. The OS Office actively animates and supports these activities.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Helmholtz&#39;s participation in the international <a href="https://rd-alliance.org/">Research Data Alliance (RDA)</a> and in <a href="https://www.rda-deutschland.de/">Research Data Alliance Germany (RDA-DE)</a> is also accompanied and coordinated by the Helmholtz Open Science Office. Moreover, the OS Office is active in <a href="https://www.helmholtz.de/open-science-subsite/en/newsroom/projects/">third-party funded projects</a> on open research data and persistent identifiers, such as <a href="https://os.helmholtz.de/de/projekte/re3data-coref/">re3data COREF</a> and <a href="https://os.helmholtz.de/de/projekte/orcid-de/">ORCID DE</a>.</p>

    <p>The work of the Helmholtz Open Science Office thus complements the developments of platforms in the Helmholtz Incubator and contributes to the utilization of the <a href="https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/">FAIR principles</a> in Helmholtz, such as the <a href="https://helmholtz-metadaten.de/de">Helmholtz Metadata Collaboration (HMC)</a>.</p>

  title: 'Hanging out your open science shingle: launching an open science program
    by supporting a new graduate cohort'
  description: <p>In 2019, librarians at the University of California, Berkeley, began
    a pilot program to introduce open science workflows. The Earth and Planetary Sciences
    (EPS) Department was chosen as the target department for this work due to prior
    connections and its relatively small graduate cohorts. The program began with
    an overhaul of the library&#39;s traditional orientation session, replacing content
    focused on library policies, procedures and resources with a new approach that
    instead addresses opportunities for open practices within local research workflows.
    Through collaboration with the department chair, faculty graduate student advisors
    and the graduate student affairs officer, the library constructed a year-long
    curriculum on open science practices and reproducibility within the Earth Sciences.
    This talk will address the challenges of introducing open science practices on
    a large campus, describing the opportunities and obstacles encountered while working
    with a small graduate cohort.</p>

  title: 'Including open science to research projects since their submission: a library
    perspective'
  description: |-
    <p>More and more research funding agencies define obligations on open science which include open access to publications and good research data management practices (data management plan, FAIR principles). Though these requirements have been enforced for several years they do not always reach their aim. For instance, it is estimated that only 81% of publications funded by H2020 are in open access (from figures available on OpenAIRE website: : <a href="https://monitor.openaire.eu/h2020-stats-new">https://monitor.openaire.eu/h2020-stats-new</a>, 20/12/2018). Good data management practices are even harder to monitor for funders and DMP writing does not always lead to practices improvement and to data openness.</p>

    <p>Funders like the European Commission or the French National Agency for Research (ANR) require a DMP only from funded projects. It means that most of the projects have not seriously considered data management and open science at the submission stage. Once the project is funded, it may be difficult to comply with open science requirements: it may occur that research partners do not agree on the level of data sharing or that no appropriate budget is dedicated to data preservation and dissemination. Funders requirements then appear to be only an administrative obligation which often leads to poor quality of practices and minimum data openness.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>This poster presents a new service implemented by the University Library of Lille to support researchers to take into account all dimensions of open science since the submission of their projects. Collaborating with other university services, we insist on integrating open science as a part of the project management activities by transforming obligations into objectives, deliverables and budget. Doing so, we make sure open science objectives and resources are well balanced. It is an opportunity for researchers to improve their project proposals and it is often appreciated by project reviewers. As a librarian, it is the best way to be considered as a partner and to create a strong relation with the project coordinator.</p>

    <p>Once a project is funded, the Library helps researchers to address open science issues and put into practice their commitments. A librarian is designated as the project open science manager. On open access, projects coordinators and their teams are provided with guidelines on funding signaling, on funders requirements and on self-archiving rights&hellip; Every publication related to the project has to be self-archived by researchers and signaled to the open science manager who makes sure the publications dissemination fulfills the project obligations. For H2020 projects, the open science manager checks that every publication is properly reported on the European Commission tools (OpenAIRE, participant portal). The open science manager is the contact point on open science issues for the European Commission projects officers. For mid-term or final reporting, the librarian produces a report on publications which includes information on open access dissemination, impact&hellip; Project coordinators and their teams are informed on research data management during the project kick-off meeting and other working meetings. Help is provided to write the project data management plan and specific guidance is proposed so that researchers are able to make relevant choices for research data management.</p>

  title: 'Open Education Policies: Guidelines for co-creation'
  description: |-
    <p>These guidelines aim to support institutions and governments in the development of open education policies promoting the adoption of open educational practices and resources, and the fostering of collaborations amongst social-educational actors which favour the democratisation of knowledge access and production.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>The purpose of this guide is to support policymakers, understood in a broad sense here to include a range of stakeholders, to design appropriate policies for their contexts and communities. Rather than the detail of policy, the focus of this guide is on the process of policymaking, through which the detail should emerge. Although policy might be often thought of as the work of managers, governments or experts that is then adopted, disseminated to the masses and implemented, we consider that, as &lsquo;openness policies&rsquo; need to create public value, a transversal and democratic approach to policymaking is necessary. Furthermore, co-creation can be a factor in policy effectiveness, as the sense of co-ownership in a community can enhance the shared responsibility to achieve policy goals (Voorberg, Bekkers &amp; Tummers, 2015; Bryson, Sancino, Benington &amp; S&oslash;rensen, 2017).&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Therefore, we aim with these guidelines to support policymakers and advocates from governments and academia at the national, regional and institutional levels, in adopting a co-creation approach across the policy cycle, toward development of OE policies, strategies, action plans and roadmaps. We also consider these guidelines should be relevant for other institutions or organisations seeking to foster OE, such as civil society, GLAM sector and non-profit organisations, and as well for the Open Science sector, as UNESCO (2020b) recommends&nbsp;<em>promoting the use of Open Educational Resources to increase access to Open Science educational and research resources.</em></p>

    <p>This guide has been co-created in collaboration with the Mediterranean Universities Union (UNIMED) and is, in part, based on the&nbsp;<em>Recommendations from OpenMed to University leaders and policy makers for opening up Higher Education in the South-Mediterranean by 2030</em>, and follows the OGP Participation &amp; Co-Creation Standards. These recommendations have been co-authored, reviewed and edited by a group of policy and open education experts.</p>

  title: 'Developing a REPO Assessment Workbook: Supporting Open Science Communities
    in the Transition to Online Learning'
  description: '<p>During the Covid-19 health emergency, the issue of scientific collaboration
    has received unprecedented attention and with it a renewed public interest in
    open science. In this context, elements of open science&mdash;such as preprints,
    open access to publications, and open data resources&mdash;are critically valorized
    as crucial components to be enhanced in preparation for future crises. Less discussed
    is the issue of open science pedagogy, its critical importance, and the shifts
    Open Science communities have experienced in the pandemic with the move to online
    working, teaching and learning. How do we learn to be &lsquo;open&rsquo; in open
    research? The Reimagining Educational Practices for Open (REPO) project examines
    this question through a practitioner led exploration of how Open Science communities
    have navigated the transition to online and hybrid formats. In this workshop,
    we will review REPO&rsquo;s ongoing community engagement efforts to document change
    and best practices in open online training and education. We then present two
    related outcomes of our work: 1. A framework for integrating and comparing insights
    from multiple communities of practice; 2. A prototype reflection and assessment
    workbook for open science educators working to build participatory learning communities.
    The workshop will include some time collaboratively thinking about how to construct
    assessment tools for open science learning communities as they move to online
    or hybrid formats.</p>'

  description: <p>The open science practices identified will be used to inform the
    development of an automated open science dashboard which can be deployed by biomedical
    institutions to efficiently monitor adoption and educate researchers in various
    open science practices. The dashboard will build on previous work by our team,

    in an institutional open science dashboard through a consensus building process
    with relevant stakeholders, we aim to ensure the tool is appropriate to the needs
    of the community. This approach might also increase the chances of uptake and

  title: 'Open Research Data Platform in Indonesia: National Scientific Repository'
  description: |-
    <p>As an archipelago country, Indonesia has many research resources from natural science (biodiversity) to social science and humanities. It mainly produces scientific articles or prototypes and puts them in a specific repository. <em>But, how about the raw data? </em></p>

    <p>In supporting the open data movement, Indonesia made a specific regulation related to the National System for Science and Technology, No.11/2019. Article 40 stated that there is a requirement for scientific data deposit in research activities funded by the government. This law supports the effort of the Centre for Scientific Data and Documentation (PDDI), Indonesian Institute of Sciences (LIPI) after developing the National Scientific Repository (Repositori Ilmiah Nasional/RIN) since 2016. This repository is categorized as an open research data platform (using Dataverse).</p>

    <p>Research data cycles are carried out from planning to preservation and reuse. It means the research output at each stage produces data that can be valued as intangible assets. The importance of data preservation could be seen in how 80 percent of original scientific data acquired through publicly funded research is lost within two decades. Scientific work with primary data is essential to improve the quality of research. Therefore, PDDI LIPI focuses on its capacity to support open science through RIN (www.rin.lipi.go.id). The increasing awareness of open data in Indonesia has made researchers put their data into RIN to ensure its accessibility and preservation. RIN, as the focal point, enhances data deposit through FAIR principles to be adopted by Indonesian researchers via basic and advanced training. Another approach is also implemented on the Open Journal System and RIN for its manuscript submission and supplementary files. However, some challenges do arise, from researchers&rsquo; ignorance because of intellectual property, which has been covered through creative commons licenses and Handle (DOI); to the workload of depositing data, which is why librarians will be the example of functioning research support systems.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile, the pandemic situation urges scientific communities to have better interactions, communications, and collaborations, which is borderless. The crisis could be like a blessing in disguise just because it inevitably increases the use of open data platforms and demonstrates the importance of its existence for massive scientific development. RIN Dataverse got more comprehensive engagements by having a role as the data repository for the Indonesian National Health System Consortium, which supports around twentieth institutions in Indonesia in contributing to the reformation of the system for the Pandemic Case. Other practices could be seen in the program entitled Citizen Science &ndash; Hackathon for Cultural Assets by engaging the young generations to deposit the cultural data found in their community into RIN. This is one example of how citizen science could have a real engagement to preserve Indonesian traditional culture, for instance, languages (748 local languages), architecture or ethnic groups (633 recognized groups).</p>

    <p>On a long-term basis, it could also lead to a satisfactory data-driven policy and decisionmaking to be conducted and disseminated to Indonesian&rsquo;s and world wide&rsquo;s stakeholders because good research (and policy) needs good data.</p>

  title: Winning Grants with Open Science & RRI
  description: |-
    <p>Horizon EU commit firmly to the practices of &quot;Open Science&quot; and &quot;Responsible Research &amp; Innovation&quot;, but the level of awareness among the average grant applicant lags significantly behind. Average applicant tends to address these new requirements as a &quot;check list&quot;, while making them essential philosophy of the research method design can add a competitive edge at proposal evaluation.<br>
    <br>
    The presentation will showcase two parallel experiment at Un. Lille (France) and Technical University Denmark (DTU), targeting different national and EU grant calls, and research cultures.<br>
    <br>
    At both sites, the approach was to pro-actively integrate Open Science in national and EU grant proposals, in order to test if going above and beyond funder requirements on Open Science could give applicants a competitive edge.<br>
    <br>
    Strategies and advocacy was developed to integrate Open Science in all proposal sections: from adding excellence to a reproducible research methodology, to enhancing impact &amp; exploitation in synergy with intellectual property (IP) practices, and broadening dissemination and communication with Citizen Scientists.<br>
    <br>
    Approaches included designing specific Open Science actions and deliverables, as part of the research process, accompanied by appropriate budget that matches ambition, and capitalizes on institutional capacity to implement Open Science.<br>
    <br>
    Evidence from multi-annual reiterations clearly demonstrates that Open Science, when credibly coupled to pro-active knowledge transfer strategies and Citizen Science/Science Literacy outreach activities, clearly adds a competitive advantage to research grant proposals. The lessons learned are generic, discipline-agnostic to a large degree and potentially easily transferable to any national funding research grant instrument (or research support team).</p>

    <p>As European Commission steps up the discourse on societal challenges relevance of access to publicly-funded research (e.g. Manifesto for EU COVID-19 Research https://ec.europa.eu/info/research-and-innovation/research-area/health-research-and-innovation/coronavirus-research-and-innovation/covid-research-manifesto_en), research support staff can be a key multiplier in Open Science uptake across all research disciplines.</p>

    <p><strong>Learning Outcomes:</strong></p>

    <p>Attendees will:<br>
    - appreciate that Open Science is much broader than the prevalent &quot;Open Access to publications&quot; debate;<br>
    - learn how Open Science provokes positive proposal evaluations in all sections of a proposal;<br>
    - learn how to support applicants to integrate Open Science in every proposal.</p>

  title: 'Open Data Science Mesh: friction-free collaboration for researchers bridging
    High-Energy Physics and European Open Science Cloud'
  description: 'Open Data Science Mesh (CS3MESH4EOSC) is a newly funded project to
    create a new generation, interoperable federation of data and higher-level services
    to enable friction-free collaboration between European researchers.     This new
    EU-funded project brings together 12 partners from the CS3 community (Cloud Synchronization
    and Sharing Services). The consortium partners include CERN, Danish Technical
    University (DK), SURFSARA (NL), Poznan Supercomputing Centre (PL), CESNET (CZ),
    AARNET (AUS), SWITCH (CH), University of Munster (DE), Ailleron SA (PL), Cubbit
    (IT), Joint Research Centre (BE) and Fundacion ESADE (ES). CERN acts as project
    coordinator.     The consortium already operates services and storage-centric
    infrastructure for around 300 thousand scientists and researchers across the globe.
    The project will integrate these local existing sites and services into a seamless
    mesh infrastructure which is fully interconnected with the EOSC-Hub, as proposed
    in the European Commission''s Implementation Roadmap for EOSC.     The project
    will provide a framework for applications in several major areas: Data Science
    Environments, Open Data Systems, Collaborative Documents, On-demand Large Dataset
    Transfers and Cross-domain Data Sharing.    The collaboration between the users
    will be enabled by a simple sharing mechanism: a user will select a file or folder
    to share with other users at other sites. Such shared links will be established
    and removed dynamically by the users from a streamline web interface of their
    local storage systems. The mesh will automatically and contextually enable different
    research workflow actions based on type of content shared in the folder. One of
    the excellence areas of CS3 services is access to content from all types of devices:
    web, desktop applications and mobile devices. The project augments this capability
    to access content stored on remote sites and will *in practice* introduce FAIR
    principles in European Science.    The project with leverage on technologies developed
    and integrated in the research community, such as ScienceBox (CERNBox, SWAN, EOS),
    EGI-CheckIn, File Transfer Service (FTS), ARGO, EduGAIN and others. The project
    will also involve commercial cloud providers, integrating their software and services'

  title: 'Repurposing Open Source Tools for Open Science: a Practical Guide'
  description: |-
    <p>Open science &ndash; i.e., the practice of conducting scientific research in a way that is transparent, reproducible, and openly accessible to all &ndash; is gaining increasing attention and popularity. For instance, the European OpenAIRE project is supporting a vision for open access and open data, by providing researchers with the necessary guidance and tools to conduct open science. Moreover, YERUN, a network of Young European Research Universities founded a working group to coordinate the adoption of open science research practices at European universities. This poster demonstrates how open science can be further advanced using existing tools that are already widely used by open source communities. We combine systems originating from (1) the open source movement, (2) the digital legal initiative, and (3) recent results from the open science movement itself. Our idea is to dedicate one service to each step in the research process. For example, GitHub can be used for document management. OriginStamp, a blockchain-based distributed timestamping service, can be used to prove the originality of data and computations. Travis, a continuous integration service, can be used for automation and objective execution and, lastly, the research data repository Zenodo can be used to generate immutable, durable, and accessible final research artifacts. However, only in combining each of the services used during the individual steps of the research cycle, will scientists be able to generate reproducible and open scientific results. In the vision we present, the blockchain technology that enables the tamper-proof timestamping of final research artefacts and &ndash; even more importantly &ndash; intermediate results, is a game changer. The existence of tamper-proof documentation for each incremental research step improves reproducibility without forcing researchers to perform each research step immediately open to the public.<br>
    In this poster, we exemplify the proposed combined approach using a typical research scenario: We describe how to collaboratively write a paper in LaTeX and publish it in an open research data repository. We also provide background information on the open source services used in each step. Finally, we outline how researchers can adapt the presented seven-step procedure to other scientific tasks, such as planning a user study, running a simulation, or developing a software prototype.<br>

  title: Developing Metrics for Assessing the Impact of Open Science Services
  description: <p>The future of scholarly communication requires researchers to share
    data and other research products, in accordance with open science principles.
    Open science not only helps satisfy funder and publisher mandates and accelerate
    the dissemination of research, but importantly, facilitates collaboration and
    makes research more reproducible and reusable. Many academic institutions have
    established institutional repositories and open-access programs to support open
    data and publishing. However, these initiatives often emphasize the end product
    of research. At Carnegie Mellon University, we implemented the Open Science &amp;
    Data Collaborations (OSDC) program, within University Libraries, that helps embed
    open science practices into the entire research lifecycle by providing tools,
    training, opportunities for collaboration, community-building events, and advocacy.
    The OSDC program has supported numerous researchers and their projects and has
    created strong partnerships with academic departments and university leadership.
    Recently, we have turned our attention to developing metrics to evaluate the impact
    of the program and open science more broadly on research activity. We first collected
    data that includes event and workshop registrations, platform usage, and feedback
    from a user advisory group. Analysis of this dataset, along with a logic model
    that depicts the program activity and outcomes,&nbsp; will help to develop more
    in-depth evaluation metrics and a toolkit, launch targeted surveys, and identify
    priority service areas and interesting open science projects. Our program implementation
    and assessment can serve as a model for others to implement open science initiatives
    on their campuses. We also welcome partnership with other universities to form
    an alliance of open science programs that supports open science as it continues
    to evolve.</p>

    this workshop, speakers will discuss how key organisations like the European University
    Association (EUA) and the League of European Research Universities (LERU) are
    acting as trailblazers for Open Science and Open Access, and how ORE can be an
    important tool to utilise towards this cause. The most common questions and concerns
    that researchers have when it comes to publishing through ORE will be discussed,
    and the importance of ORE advocacy amongst research librarians will be addressed.
    The workshop will cumulate in a panel discussion designed to create synergies
    that will cement ORE as key tool that librarians can advocate for, and researchers
    can use to publish their work in an open and transparent manner.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Speakers</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Kelly

    <p>Swissuniversities developed the Open Science programme to support the implementation of national action plans on Open Access and Open Research Data. The programme encourages Swiss higher education institutions to collaborate with each other and submit project proposals addressing the objectives and action lines set by the national strategies.</p>

    <p>This good practice is part of a collection presented in the report &quot;Good Practices in FAIR Competence Education&quot;, which aims to provides universities with points of inspiration and practical examples of how fellow institutions and organisations in the higher education sector addressed the need for more RDM and FAIR data-related skills to be taught at the bachelor, master and doctoral levels. The report was developed in the framework of the Fostering FAIR Data Practices in Europe (FAIRsFAIR) project.</p>

    <p>Presentation for the 2019 SKA Science Meeting: <a href="https://indico.skatelescope.org/event/467/">New Science enabled by New Technologies in the SKA Era</a> held at Alderley Park in Alderley Edge, United Kingdom from April 8-12, 2019 (talk given on Monday, 8/4/2019 in session 3).</p>

    <p>Abstract: Making research results more accessible and reproducible can contribute to better and more efficient science, however widespread adoption of open research practices has not yet been achieved. Funding agencies (such as the European Commission Horizon 2020) are increasingly requiring research products (such as data and publications) to be made openly available in order to make results more accessible, transparent and reproducible. Recent studies have also shown that open research practices are associated with benefits to the researcher such as increases in citations, media attention, potential collaborators, job and funding opportunities. In this talk I will discuss the different aspects of Open Science, the barriers we face to practicing openly, how to &quot;open&quot; up your research workflow using open and transparent data and software services in order to reap the benefits associated with open research practices. I will also highlight current projects to make SKA Era workflows reproducible.</p>

  title: Fostering Institutional Collaboration through Disciplinary Open Research
    Data Repositories project
  description: |-
    <p>The talk will explain the role, activities, and context of the Disciplinary Open Research Data Repositories project run in Poland by the University of Warsaw and its partners. It will focus on the research data infrastructure elements that foster collaboration with other organisations and support the uptake of research data management &amp; FAIR practice within universities and scientific institutes.</p>

    <p>The talk will cover the partnership within the Disciplinary Open Research Data Repositories project that aims to develop disciplinary repositories (Macromolecular Xtallography Raw Data Repository MX-RDR and Social Data Repository RDS) as well as agreements with various research performing organisations interested in setting up institutional collections in the generalist Repository for Open Data RepOD.</p>

    <p>Key aspects of institutional collaboration will be discussed, such as sharing best practices and knowledge, addressing legal aspects of open science and setting the research data infrastructure mission in the broader research context. Taking into consideration the project aims &ndash; improving the quality of the data and metadata and facilitating better use of scientific resources, among others &ndash; the talk will also highlight the progress towards sustainable data sharing that can be achieved by increasing the uptake of available services.</p>

    <p>The talk will also take into account the situation in Poland: the ongoing development of data management policies. During the implementation of the project (2018-2021) significant changes in the research context occurred as the main funding agency in Poland, National Science Centre, introduced open science policy and mandatory research data management plans. Also, an increasing number of research organizations adopted open access policies.&nbsp; The motivation for the talk is to share experiences in the development of research data infrastructure and to discuss a framework for building a sustainable collaboration model.</p>

  title: Embedded accessibility in repository and open journal services
  description: |-
    <p>We are the Research Support and Scholarly Communications team at the University of Kent.  Our role is to provide help and guidance to staff and students engaged in research and to manage the systems that support the research.   These include the Kent Academic Repository, the Kent Data Repository, and our Open Journal System. Our poster will describe how we are improving accessibility across these systems and the services that support them.<br>
    We had been aware for some time that the open access repository platforms and the content were not conforming to basic accessibility requirements, but the legislative deadline added urgency to our plans for change. The need for an accessibility statement for all our web-based systems encouraged us to look closely at, and find solutions for, the issues users of assistive technology encountered when accessing our systems and their content. In an open access environment &ndash; access needs to be open for all our users.<br>
    We will describe our process and how we worked with colleagues in IT systems development and student services to create new methodologies and embed inclusive practices. Solutions included technical fixes, procedural changes and training and advocacy. We explore the challenges, what went well and what we have learnt, how we shared news about this work, and how we are committing to future digital content accessibility developments in research and scholarly communication support at the University of Kent.  </p>

  title: 'Open science and communities of researchers: the big gap in training. A
    case study at Sorbonne University'
  description: |-
    <p>In 2019, the newly formed Sorbonne University, created in 2018 by the merger of the universities Paris-Sorbonne and Pierre-et-Marie-Curie, adopted a strategic 5-year plan for 2019-2023 that put the promotion and development of Open Science as one of its four core principles. The strong institutional and political support for open science allowed the transition from the support of best practices to the adoption of a set of institutional policies, on open access publication, open data and data management plans, and on the evaluation of research and the allocation of institutional funding. This institutional strategy is also based on the Open Science national policy (Law for a digital republic in 2016, national plan for open science in 2018 and 2021) and European incentives (European funders&rsquo; policies). The mainstreaming of open science practices is also at work within the alliances in which SU is involved, especially the 4EU+ European University Alliance (Sorbonne, Prague, Heidelberg, Warsaw, Milan and Copenhagen) developing cooperation in teaching, education and research.</p>

    <p>The challenge for Sorbonne University is to have the researchers adopt these policies in their scientific practice. It is a challenging task, requiring a small team to provide a coherent service answering the needs of a large and very heterogeneous community, with sometimes conflicting needs.</p>

    <p>In a case study of Sorbonne University&rsquo;s Open Science training, this paper will highlight how flexibility and pragmatism helped the framing of a coherent training program addressing the needs of open science novices as well as experienced practitioners. It presents the options chosen to train on a large and international scales and the &ldquo;&agrave;-la-carte&rdquo; sessions answering the specific needs of each community.</p>

    <p>The paper also shows which skills and job profiles are needed to support a wide range of training. Some of these skills were found within the Sorbonne University Library (librarians, but also an archivist and a paleontologist), but it was also necessary to establish collaborations with other university services (ie, accompanying researchers in digital methods and data storage) for a more specific training on certain subjects.</p>

    <p>The paper also describes the network built with research-related staff in direct proximity to the researchers (open science referents, project managers, etc.) on which the library relies to promote the training program.</p>

    <p>Finally, it will present how the involvement in the 4EU+ Alliance created the opportunity to further expand the training on Open Science for an even wider and more diverse community, with the 4EU+ Open Science training program, built in collaboration with partners from six different universities during the COVID crisis and delivered online from November 2021 to July 2022.</p>

    <p>Presentation of the publication &#39;The Open Science Guide of Guides&#39; for OAT21</p>

    <p>Open Science has become an indispensable part of modern science. There are several definitions of &quot;openness&quot; in relation to different aspects of science - the Open Definition sets out principles as follows &ldquo;Open means anyone can freely access, use, modify, and share for any purpose (subject, at most, to requirements that preserve provenance and openness).&rdquo; Practical guides for the implementation of those principles in different areas such as research data or publishing are of great importance because they can be used right away.</p>

  title: Leveraging Open Science in Machine Learning and Bioinformatics
  description: |-
    <p>Biology has become a rich, data-intensive science dependent on complex, computational, and statistical methods, where machine learning and deep learning algorithms can be leveraged to provide novel insights for complex biological questions.&nbsp; Open Science has been instrumental in making these methods accessible to researchers while ensuring scientific results remain reproducible. This talk will discuss how open science practices can boost bioinformatics research and open new avenues for promoting scientific discovery by extending the principle of openness to the whole research cycle.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>We will explore examples of how Open Science is applied in the field of machine learning and computational biology. We will also look into both the challenges and advantages of applying Open Science practices in the ever-evolving field of machine learning. We aim to prompt attendees to reflect on specific concerns and practices that impact data science and bioinformatics research. We will be using a shared document for collaborative note-taking to capture the diverse experience of the participants and derive actions to help more communities adopt open science practices.</p>

  title: ITC's Strategic Plan for Open Science 2021-2025 - Towards an Open Future
  description: |-
    <p><em>Open Science </em>(OS) is an umbrella term comprising principles to increase the transparency of research. Besides Open Access to scientific articles, these principles contain public availability of reusable methods (e.g., code and tools), data, and educational materials. This document outlines a plan to achieve the transition towards OS. <em>ITC&rsquo;s Strategic Plan for OS 2021-2025 - Towards an Open Future</em> contains five initiatives:</p>

    <p>1.<strong>OS at ITC </strong>aims to provide guidelines and OS capacity development to address the obstacles ITC researchers encounter when doing OS.</p>

    <p>2.<strong>The ITC Knowledge Hub </strong>will provide services and tools to access, create, and publish open research, including scientific results based on qualitative/quantitative analyses using computational workflows.</p>

    <p>3.<strong>Open Educational Resources </strong>will be addressed by exploring options to realise Open Educational Resources at ITC and providing lecturers with guidelines and support to create them.</p>

    <p>4.<strong>The OS Community Twente </strong>serves as an inter-disciplinary, bottom-up community to promote, learn, share, and discuss OS practices.</p>

    <p>5.<strong>Research &amp; Funding </strong>aims to address challenges in OS through innovative developments and user studies. A further output is to generate funding to realise the ambitious aims presented in the plan.</p>

    <p>For a successful OS transition, the initiatives aim to address the <em>Rewards &amp; Recognition</em> system, valorise <em>Sharing &amp; Collaboration</em>, develop OS <em>Knowledge &amp; Skills</em>, and foster <em>Cultural change &amp; Societal impact</em>.</p>

  title: Open Science in Astronomy
  description: |-
    <p>My talk for EWASS 2018, Session 6: Software in Astronomy, Thursday, 5th April 9:00.</p>

    <p>Making research results more accessible can contribute to better and more efficient science, however widespread adoption of open research practices has not yet been achieved. Funding agencies (such as the European Commission Horizon 2020) are increasingly requiring research products (such as data and publications) to be made openly available in order to make results more accessible, transparent and reproducible. Recent studies have also shown that open research practices are associated with benefits to the researcher such as increases in citations, media attention, potential collaborators, job and funding opportunities. In this talk I will discuss the different aspects of Open Science, the barriers we face to practicing openly, how to &quot;open&quot; up your research workflow using open and transparent data and software services in order to reap the benefits associated with open research practices, and highlight current open projects in Astronomy.</p>

  title: Open Phenotypic Drug Discovery Resource (OPDDR)
  description: |-
    <p><strong>Linking the Open Phenotypic Drug Discovery Resource (OPDDR) </strong></p>

    <p>OPDDR is a collaboration involving Eli Lilly&rsquo;s Open Innovation Drug Discovery (OIDD) program, NIH National Center for Advanced Translational Science (NCATS), and the Indiana University Integrative Data Science Lab (IDSL). Compounds from the NCATS Pharmaceutical Collection (NPC) were screened against the OIDD assay panel, with relevance to cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, cancer and endocrine disorders. Methodology and results have been published in the literature, a home page, and via PubChem Bioassay. The OPDDR team understands that linking and integrating these data with relevant public resources magnifies their benefit to the scientific community, and considers OpenPHACTS as an ideal vehicle for this integration. Accordingly, the IU IDSL has been tasked with translating the OPDDR dataset to RDF with a data model aligned with OpenPHACTS and other public standards. This poster describes the resulting dataset, and its biomedical research value, with focus on the process of linking and integrating a novel dataset with OpenPHACTS and o ther public resources and standards, especially ChEMBL and PubChem. It is important to note that &ldquo;standards&rdquo; in this sense implies communities of developers and users, and joining with these communities involves technical and nontechnical challenges, but offers considerable rewards through shared, aligned efforts.</p>

  title: 'NSF CSSI proposal: An open source software ecosystem for plasma physics'
  description: <p>The research team will lead the development of PlasmaPy and affiliated
    packages to foster the creation of an open source software ecosystem for plasma
    physics. The PlasmaPy core package will contain functionality needed by plasma
    physicists across disciplines, whereas affiliated packages will contain more specialized
    functionality. At the beginning of the project, the research team will refactor
    existing code, improve tests, formalize the software architecture, and improve
    PlasmaPy&#39;s base data structures in order to provide a solid foundation for
    future development. Subsequent code development priorities include a dispersion
    relation solver for plasma waves and instabilities, the groundwork for a flexible
    framework for plasma simulation, time series turbulence analysis tools, classes
    for the analysis of plasma diagnostics, and tools to provide access to atomic
    and physical data. They will make base data structures compatible with open source
    packages for data science to enable future data science studies. The research
    team will actively seek input and feedback from the plasma physics community,
    and adjust code development priorities based on this feedback. The team will hold
    workshops each year and actively support new users and contributors to grow PlasmaPy
    into a self-sustaining project.</p>

  title: 'Examining Open Innovation in Science (OIS): what Open Innovation can and
    cannot offer the science of science'
  description: '<p>Scholars across disciplines increasingly hear calls for more open
    and collaborative approaches to scientific research. The concept of Open Innovation
    in Science (OIS) provides a framework that integrates dispersed research efforts
    aiming to understand the antecedents, contingencies, and consequences of applying
    open and collaborative research practices. While the OIS framework has already
    been taken up by science of science scholars, its conceptual underpinnings require
    further specification. In this essay, we critically examine the OIS concept and
    bring to light two key aspects: 1) how OIS builds upon Open Innovation (OI) research
    by adopting its attention to boundary-crossing knowledge flows and by adapting
    other concepts developed and researched in OI to the science context, as exemplified
    by two OIS cases in the area of research funding; 2) how OIS conceptualises knowledge
    flows across boundaries. While OI typically focuses on well-defined organisational
    boundaries, we argue that blurry and even invisible boundaries between communities
    of practice may more strongly constrain flows of knowledge related to openness
    and collaboration in science. Given the uptake of this concept, this essay brings
    needed clarity to the meaning of OIS, which has no particular normative orientation
    towards a close coupling between science and industry. We end by outlining the
    essay&rsquo;s contributions to OI and the science of science, as well as to science
    practitioners.</p>'

    <p>The researchers working in the project <a href="https://zdin.de/zukunftslabore/energie">ZLE</a> developed an &ldquo;Open Science Declaration&rdquo; committing their research activities to the standards of Open Science. Research within the ZLE will be built upon the idea of sharing scientific methods, data, and publications to improve research quality and make results accessible to the scientific and non-scientific communities.<br>
    Members of the ZLE support the principles of Open Science as expressed by the Budapest Open Access Initiative, the Berlin Declaration, the Horizon 2020 Program, and the German Strategy for Open Access.<br>
    Funded by the Ministry of Science and Culture of Lower Saxony, one of the major goals of the ZLE is to make energy research activities and its resources available for public use while preserving the intellectual property of all involved parties. This will strengthen the research in Lower Saxony by promotion and expansion of cooperation between science and industry on strategic sectors. Moreover, greater transparency in the use of public funds and in the development of research activities is enabled.</p>

  title: BE OPEN "European forum and oBsErvatory for OPEN science in transport"
  description: |-
    <p>The BE OPEN&nbsp;&ldquo;European&nbsp;forum and oBsErvatory for OPEN science in&nbsp;transport&rdquo;&nbsp;project aims to create a&nbsp;common understanding on the practical impact of Open Science and to identify and put in place the mechanisms to make it a reality in transport research.</p>

    <p>Achieving Open Access to publications, making their underlying data FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) and open where possible, and using open and collaborative processes and infrastructure via the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) will be key factors in making transportation researchers share-reuse-reproduce science and in bringing such a critical sector closer to the society for enabling open innovation and citizen science. Openness, transparency, fairness, reproducibility of science are key aspects around which BE OPEN will seek to establish the ground rules for the transport research communities, ultimately establishing a community of transport research organizations willing to work on the basis of a&nbsp;commonly agreed&nbsp;&ldquo;Open&nbsp;Science Code of&nbsp;Conduct&rdquo;.</p>

    <p>To this end, BE OPEN has brought on board key transport and open science related communities in a&nbsp;two-fold action plan: to engage them in a&nbsp;participatory&nbsp;approach fostering a dialogue on Open Science (what exists, what should be done, how it should be done) among relevant stakeholders in Europe and around the world, and develop a&nbsp;detailed roadmap for the implementation of sustainable open science modules&nbsp;which include key practices, infrastructures, policies and business models, all taking into account the specificities of the transport research domain, and the use and integration of existing- infrastructures and the emerging EOSC initiative.</p>

  description: |-
    <p><strong>Format</strong></p>

    <p>Panel discussion: Short presentation from speakers, followed by a moderated discussion based on audience questions</p>

    <p><strong>Description</strong></p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>What is your immediate reaction whenever you hear &ldquo;Open Science&rdquo; or &ldquo;Open Access&rdquo;? An administrative burden (again)? Something difficult just for the few? Something impossible within the current research evaluation system?</p>

    <p>Open Science is a huge opportunity: transparency, research quality, accountability to taxpayers&#39; money&nbsp; and especially reproducible research are at stake.</p>

    <p>In this panel discussion you will experience good practices, success stories as well as the aspects to keep in mind for the not-so-far future for pursuing Open Science.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>While researchers have navigated the Open Access publication requirements, the other aspects of open science such as publication of FAIR data and other research outputs might be relatively new.</p>

    <p>But Europe is taking strong stances toward FAIRness and Openness, so we need to get used to it if we don&#39;t want to be excluded from the European research environment of the next future.</p>

    <p>Making data FAIR might require considerable effort from researchers to manage and curate their research outputs to make them shareable: these efforts need to be acknowledged.</p>

    <p>Despite the requirements of open science, the evaluation system which places almost an exclusive focus on publications and on impact factor hasn&rsquo;t changed, which makes it difficult to engage researchers into Open Science practices.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>However things are slowly but surely changing. To present these tangible examples of change, we have put together an excellent panel representing the perspective of&nbsp; researchers, data champion community, research institutions and funding bodies.&nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>Prof. Federica Capelluti, </strong>POLITO, Open science advisor to the rector, Associate Professor in Electrical Engineering, welcome remarks and will introduce the complex dilemma of researchers to pursue open science.</p>

  title: 'Open Science and Scholarly Communication in Greece: amplifying understanding
    and building capacity through synergies'
  description: |-
    <p>Last year, the proposal for a National Open Science Plan in Greece was published outlining the steps that the national stakeholders in Research &amp; Innovation should make. The two OpenAIRE members, &ldquo;Athena&rdquo; Research Center (NOAD) and the consortium of academic libraries &ldquo;HEAL-Link&rdquo;, have a long standing cooperation in the country. They support each other&#39;s work by building the bridges between academia and research, and laying the foundations for the sustainable implementation of Open Science in Greece. In particular, they exchange knowledge and practices on:<br>
    - (co-)developing data services that follow best practices to enable FAIRness of data and EOSC compatibility, such as through the Hellenic Data Service &ldquo;HELIX&rdquo; and the University data repositories &ldquo;HARDMIN&rdquo;.<br>
    - promoting skills on Open Science and Research Data Management (RDM) to incubate competencies of researchers as well as to contribute to upskilling and reskilling of the research support workforce.<br>
    - providing apt guidance and support in EU framework programme requests, including the COVID-19 calls, via the OpenAIRE helpdesk and the material in Greek language of the Scholarly Communication Unit of HEAL-Link.<br>
    <br>
    Moreover, &ldquo;Athena&rdquo; and HEAL-Link both perform activities to draw the bigger picture, in support of informed decision and policy making. For example, the monitoring reports by SCU/HEAL-Link are giving the community the insights to understand the progress of OA publishing in the country. Similarly, the OpenAIRE NOAD collaborates with others and initiates actions that assist in understanding the current challenges and opportunities in R&amp;I, including the EOSC and the COVID-19 crisis.<br>
    <br>
    The lighting talk will provide a detailed update on the actions that the two organisations have taken to promote Open Science in Greece.</p>

    perspective'
  description: |-
    <p>Slides presented at the DARIAH-CZ national workshop on the 21st of October (https://lindat.cz/events/workshop2021)</p>

    <p>Having a vision and a strong commitment to open research has always been important to DARIAH as it brings on collaborative and innovative means of digitally enabled research. As Open Science practices are becoming a central condition of research funding, it is even more important to establish a dedicated discourse and community practices around the open research culture as it makes sense in the arts and humanities disciplines.</p>

    <p>The presentation aims to outline discipline-specific, yet widely interoperable models of Open Science emerging from community practices of arts and humanities. It will be shown how DARIAH-EU builds an open agenda for arts and humanities research that is firmly grounded in disciplinary realities. This includes:</p>

    <p>1)Strengthening discourse and community practices around Open Humanities</p>

    <p>2) Providing training and advocacy to implement open research practices</p>

    <p>3) Building infrastructural components that enable open research practices across arts and humanities disciplines.</p>

    <p>4) Providing a strong voice for arts and humanities research communities to be heard in European and national research policy debates, with special focus on career assessment</p>

  title: 'Open Access, Open Science, Open Data: How it Was and Where We are Going'
  description: '<p>Open Access to scientific information, transparency of research
    processes and data is one of the most important conditions for the progress of
    science and scientific communication, the basis of international collaboration
    of researchers globally. The COVID-19 global pandemic has once again highlighted
    the need for open, efficient and equal access to scientific information for researchers,
    regardless of geographical, gender or any other constraints, promoting the exchange
    of scientific knowledge and data, scientific cooperation and scientific decision-making,
    knowledge and open data. The Internet has radically changed scientific communication,
    particularly on the model of peer-reviewed scientific journals and the way readers
    find and access the scientific information. Digital access is now the norm, thanks
    to the Open Access model. Although 20 years have passed since the announcement
    of the Budapest Open Access Initiative, and despite many achievements and advantages,
    there are still obstacles to the implementation of this model, there is some resistance
    from commercial publishers and other providers, and discussions continue in the
    academia world. The Open Access model is already supported by various strategies,
    policies, platforms, applications but is not yet established. Various business
    models for scientific journals are still being tested, a culture of preprints
    is being formed, and discussions are underway on the ethics of scientific publications,
    intellectual property, the need to finance the dissemination of research results,
    and so on. Various platforms and applications are being developed to help researchers
    &ldquo;discover&rdquo; research results. Nevertheless, this is not enough: it
    is important to &ldquo;discover&rdquo; not only the results but also the research
    data, allowing them be used for further research in the global world. Thus, the
    concepts and practices of Open Science, Open Data, development of research infrastructures,
    etc., are developing quite rapidly. The article considers the main stages of this
    20-year path and outlines the main components and trends of the current stage.
    Emphasis is placed on the need to form a culture of Open Science and create incentives
    for its implementation, promoting innovative methods of Open Science at different
    stages of the scientific process, the needs of European integration of Ukrainian
    e-infrastructure development, the need for socio-cultural and technological change.
    The main international and domestic practices and projects in Open Access and
    Open Science, particularly the National Repository of Academic Texts and the National
    Plan of Open Science draft, are considered. The role of libraries and librarians
    in implementing the principles of Open Access and Open Science is emphasized.</p>'

    have been produced in the framework of the <em>&lsquo;Study on open access to
    publications and research data management and sharing within ERC projects&rsquo;.
    </em>This study has been procured by the ERC Executive Agency under contract number
    ERCEA/A1/2016/06.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The following three case studies are included
    in this set:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Our Mythical Childhood... The Reception of Classical
    Antiquity in Children&rsquo;s and Young Adults&rsquo; Culture in Response to Regional
    and Global Challenges (OurMythicalChildhood)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Professor Katarzyna
    Marciniak has assembled an international team of researchers to study the intersection
    of classical antiquity and children&rsquo;s and young adults&rsquo; culture in
    several regions across the the globe. <a href=\"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/205179_en.html\">OurMythicalChildhood</a>
    is developing&nbsp;an openly accessible supra-regional survey of classical references
    and engages in a myriad of science communication activities both online and face-to-face.
    The team is united by the same vision &ndash; to share their research results
    as soon as possible in order to facilitate their dissemination, immediate uptake
    and further use.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>The Intergenerational Cumulative Disadvantage

    his team have come to appreciate the benefits of open science practices while
    working on the ERC project <a href=\"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/185679_en.html\">INDIRECT</a>.
    Professor Erola was not highly aware of open access issues before receiving his
    Consolidator Grant in 2013. Currently his team aims to ensure open access to articles
    and books as much as possible and have also set up an online platform to disseminate
    their working papers while they are undergoing peer review. These approaches provide
    opportunities for the team to generate greater interest in their work and achieve
    a wider impact through their published works.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Computational
    models for the discovery of the world&#39;s music (CompMusic)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In
    the <a href=\"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/99349_en.html\">CompMusic</a>
    project, Professor Xavier Serra&rsquo;s Music Technology Group used an ERC Advanced
    Grant to develop their open science practices in a manner that helped answer their
    research questions, and enhance the opportunities for commercialisation of the
    results. Their research is interdisciplinary, developing computational approaches
    to support the scholarly analysis of music. CompMusic was particularly focused
    on five non-Western musical traditions and developed a software framework for
    data analysis. Lacking research data repositories and standards specialised for
    this relatively new domain, the Group constructed an approach that combines locally
    engineered open source software frameworks and open data collections. These are
    managed and shared across a variety of community databases. Through user-provided
    content and usage the open collections help with software enhancements. Using
    a dual-licensing model, the software can then be commercialised and generate income
    streams from subscribers, while also being made available under open source licenses
    for non-commercial use.</p>"

    <p><strong>About</strong><br>
    This presentation was given at the <a href="https://www.ibmt.fraunhofer.de/">Fraunhofer Institute for Biomedical Engineering</a> (IBMT) on 30 April 2021. The audience was encouraged to pose questions and comments immediately rather than at the end, which led to a lively discussion throughout the talk, to the extent that some of the slides - or even things they simply alluded to - were discussed in a quite detailed manner, while other slides were essentially skipped. In contrast, the etherpad provided as a backchannel ended up not being used at all.</p>

    <p>The slides used for the presentation were prepared on Google docs and then downloaded from there in PDF, ODP and PPTX formats. They are accompanied here by a video recording (in MOV format) of a separate run of the presentation. That recording is also available on YouTube via <a href="https://youtu.be/2BW_HisTBnE">https://youtu.be/2BW_HisTBnE</a> .</p>

    <p><br>
    <strong>Abstract</strong><br>
    The research ecosystem is continuously evolving, and some of the prominent trends in recent years included the broader adoption of the principles of open science and FAIR data. In short, open science emphasizes reproducibility and collaboration, while the FAIR Principles (where FAIR stands for resources being Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) enable both humans and automated actors to be active participants in the research process. This presentation is intended to stimulate discussion about how a broader adoption of open and FAIR principles in an institutional context could be approached, with examples chosen for being relevant to the Fraunhofer Institute of Biomedical Engineering.</p>

  description: |-
    <p>Poster presenting the ANR Flash call SO-DRIIHM proposal</p>

    <p>The &quot;SO-DRIIHM&quot; project has just obtained funding from the Flash Call &quot;<em>Open Science: research practices and open research data</em>&quot; proposed by the ANR in 2019. It is managed by a group of geomatics and IT engineers within the CNRS interdisciplinary network (LabEx DRIIHM - <em>Dispositif de Recherche Interdisciplinaire sur les Interactions Hommes-Milieux</em>) of 13 Human-environment observatories (OHMs). The objective of this project (May 2020 - April 2022) is to optimize the appropriation of the open science approach by the DRIIHM research community through:</p>

    <p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the organisation of awareness campaigns showing the benefits of data sharing and openness;</p>

    <p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the co-construction of a more ergonomic and interoperable e-infrastructure, integrating existing tools (metadata geocatalogues, web GIS, photo library, HAL collection, etc.) and accompanying researchers to find, share and (re)use data with the concrete and progressive implementation of the FAIR principles (<em>Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable</em>).</p>

    <p>The originality of this project lies in the bottom-up co-construction of the e-infrastructure, involving researchers from the early stages of the project (during DRIIHM seminars and workshops) to jointly identify and support changes in practices throughout the life cycle of the data produced by OHMs.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>This project provides the opportunity to respond to the recommendations of the French National Open Science Plan and to strengthen collaboration between the researchers and the group of OHM referent engineers and scientific coordinators. It also brings together ergonomists and web development specialists (UMR IRIT Toulouse and Makina Corpus) to meet the community&#39;s expectations for all observatories.</p>

  title: 'Open Source Software in Higher Education:  Oman SQU Case Study'
  description: |-
    <p>Many organizations are opting to adopt Open Source Software (OSS) as it is the current trend to rely on each other rather than on companies (Software vendors). It is a clear shift from organizations to individuals, the concept being to rely on collective participation rather than companies/vendors.</p>

    <p>The main objectives of this research are 1) to identify the current level of OSS usage in Sultan Qaboos University; 2) to identify the potential benefits of using OSS in educational institutes; 3) to identify the OSS applications that are most likely to be used within an educational institute; 4) to identify the existing and potential barriers to the successful adoption of OSS in education.</p>

    <p>To achieve these objectives a two-stage research method was conducted. First a rigorous literature review of previously published material was performed (interpretive/descriptive approach), and then a set of interviews were conducted with the IT professionals at Sultan Qaboos University in Oman in order to explore the extent and nature of their usage of OSS.</p>

    <p>Software source code contains a growing part of the scientific and technical knowledge developed in the research activities, in all fields. It is of paramount importance to ensure that it is properly archived and referenced. The Software Heritage universal source code archive is an international non profit initiative, in collaboration with UNESCO, designed specifically to address these needs: it&nbsp;already contains over 11 billion unique source code files from over 150 million software projects. In this presentation we will see how it can enhance the research practices,&nbsp; and contribute to the Open Science mission.</p>

    <p>We will also discuss best practices for the development of maintainable and sustainable software that enhances the reliability and reproducibility of scientific research.</p>

  title: Accelerating open science and AI with automated, portable, customizable and
    reusable research components and workflows
  description: |-
    <p>The original presentation was shared via <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/GrigoriFursin/accelerating-open-science-and-ai-with-automated-portable-customizable-and-reusable-research-components-and-workflows">SlideShare</a>.</p>

    <p>Validating experimental results from articles has finally become a norm at many systems and ML conferences. Nowadays, more than half of accepted papers pass artifact evaluation and share related code and data. Unfortunately, lack of a common experimental framework, common research methodology, and common formats places an increasing burden on evaluators to validate a growing number of ad-hoc artifacts. Furthermore, having too many ad-hoc artifacts and Docker snapshots is almost as bad as not having any (!), since they cannot be easily reused, customized and built upon.<br>
    <br>
    While overviewing more than 100 papers during artifact evaluation at PPoPP, CGO, PACT, Supercomputing, and other conferences, we noticed that many of them use similar experimental setups, benchmarks, models, data sets, environments and platforms. This motivated us to develop Collective Knowledge (CK), an open workflow framework with a unified Python API to automate common researchers&rsquo; tasks such as detecting software and hardware dependencies, installing missing packages, downloading data sets and models, compiling and running programs, performing autotuning and co-design, crowdsourcing time-consuming experiments across computing resources provided by volunteers similar to SETI@home, applying statistical analysis and machine learning, validating results and plotting them on a common scoreboard for open and fair comparison, automatically generating interactive articles, and so on: <a href="http://cKnowledge.org">cKnowledge.org</a>.<br>
    <br>
    In this presentation, we will introduce CK concepts and present several real-world use cases from General Motors and Arm<br>
    on collaborative benchmarking, autotuning and co-design of efficient software/hardware stacks for deep learning. We also present results and reusable CK components from the 1st ACM ReQuEST optimization tournament: http://cKnowledge.org/request. Finally, we introduce our latest initiative to create an open repository of reusable research components and workflows to reboot and accelerate open science, quantum computing, and AI!</p>

  title: The Role of Research Managers in the Advocacy of Open Science
  description: |-
    <p>The transition to Open Science needs a cultural change across universities, research communities and funders in addition to new tools and infrastructure. Research managers have a high potential for enabling cultural change towards Open Science through their pivotal role within universities. With our poster, we want to shed light on the ways in which research managers can act as advocates for Open Science in order to support cultural change not only among researchers, but also in terms of organizational change and governance. Furthermore, we would like to outline how research managers should be trained accordingly and how they best fulfill their role in complement to experts e.g. from the library or IT-services. The objective should be to join forces and support each other.<br>
    For our poster, we refer to our experiences in the advocacy of open science practices at the Research and Innovation Services at Leibniz University Hannover (LUH). As appropriate training is a prerequisite for the support of Open Science practices, research managers at LUH together with their colleagues from the library have already attended trainings tailored to their role on the topics of Open Access and research data management. An essential part of the training is the sharing of expert knowledge of each professional group with the other. As current research assessment procedures do not align with Open Science objectives the use of responsible metrics will be added to the training program. There is a need for the further development of trainings and their professionalization as well as for more networking and exchange between librarians and research managers.</p>

  title: Matthew Effects in Open Science and RRI
  description: <p>Success in research and innovation should primarily build and depend
    on merit, on clarity of thought, innovation of ideas, and integrity of processes.
    While the state-of-play of the current scientific system is far removed from this
    ideal, open science and responsible research innovation hold the promise to change
    this for the better. ON-MERRIT (Observing and Negating Matthew Effects in Responsible
    Research &amp; Innovation Transition) investigates whether the transition to open
    science and responsible research innovation might actually worsen existing inequalities.
    To this end, the multidisciplinary team uses qualitative and computational methods
    to examine effects of cumulative (dis)advantages and eventually suggest a set
    of evidence-based recommendations for science policies, indicators and incentives.
    This talk introduces ON-MERRIT&rsquo;s rationale and aims in greater depth, as
    well as presenting initial results and discussing further steps.</p>

  title: Open Science Competency Center – towards engaging and supporting researchers
    in opening research data across disciplines
  description: |-
    <p>This poster aims to present the role of the Open Science Competence Center (OSCC) at Gdańsk University of Technology (GUT) in engaging and supporting academic scholars in opening their research data.</p>

    <p>OSCC has been established under The Bridge of Data project (Multidisciplinary Open Transfer Knowledge System - stage II: Open Research Data: Digital Poland Project Centre) in response to filling the gap in the area of scholarly communication support at the scientific institutions.</p>

    <p>Opening research data is one of the emerging trends for the researchers across the globe, however, it has to be stressed that the level of implementation and awareness of open research data varies between countries. Currently, in Poland, there is no national policy regarding Open Research Data, therefore National Science Centre who already signed Plan S, &nbsp;has set up the obligation to attached the short Data Management Plan to all grants&rsquo; applications starting from September 2019.</p>

    <p>OSCC is a team of professionals who guide researchers through different aspects and stages of data management such as legal issues, DMP or data archiving.</p>

    <p>The poster explains the workflow process of OSCC activities regarding differences in scientific disciplines represented at the GUT. Each discipline has its scholarly communication practices and should be treated individually concerning the maintaining regulations and procedures following the research data issues. Our poster shows examples of five disciplines (chemistry, civil engineering, economics and management, computer science and biology) in relations to the common problems occurred during preparing datasets for publication such as the legal aspects of opening data, preparing DMPs, storage and preserve research data.</p>

  title: The European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) and Its Implications for the Digital
    Humanities and Social Sciences
  description: "<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>Frank Fischer</em></p>\n\n<p>The
    European Open Science Cloud (EOSC), officially launched in November 2018, is an
    initiative of the European Commission aiming to develop an infrastructure that
    makes access to scientific data easier and more efficient and is geared towards
    open science. The planned infrastructure bundles services of different providers
    and is following a system-of-systems approach. Under the Horizon 2020 framework
    programme, five cluster projects from the sciences are being funded to connect
    research communities of different fields to the EOSC. One of these projects is
    SSHOC &ndash; the Social Sciences and Humanities Open Cloud.</p>\n\n<p>The five
    European Research Infrastructure Consortia CESSDA, CLARIN, DARIAH, ESS and SHARE
    as well as twenty other European partner institutions have come together to connect
    their communities to the EOSC via SSHOC. In this panel, we will discuss its emerging
    role for the Digital Humanities and related fields and the different facets needed
    to design, coordinate and operate this domain-specific infrastructure and cloud.
    We will have five speakers talk about the following topics:</p>\n\n<p><strong>The
    SSH Open Marketplace &ndash; Contextualised practical knowledge for day-to-day
    research in the Digital Humanities</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>Edward Gray</em></p>\n\n<p>Tool
    directories and discovery portals have a long history in the Digital Humanities.
    There is a clear demand for them in the community but their sustainability beyond
    project fundings and their collective maintenance is challenging (Dombrowski,
    2019; Edmond, 2016). In the enabling EOSC environment, in which research and data
    infrastructures find a suitable framework to provide research services, DARIAH,
    CLARIN and CESSDA are developing the SSH Open Marketplace, accessible at <a href=\"https://marketplace.sshopencloud.eu/\">https://marketplace.sshopencloud.eu/</a>,
    a new take on discovery platforms for tools, services, training materials, datasets
    and digital workflows (K&aacute;lm&aacute;n et al., 2019). While crowd-based maintenance
    of content is one of the only ways to ensure the quality of a &quot;social marketplace
    for services&quot; (Blanke, 2011), the SSH Open Marketplace relies on a set of
    rewards and incentives and a small, but funded, editorial team in order to avoid
    pure volunteer work of its contributors.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Sharing of Services
    and Data Between SSH Infrastructures</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>Daan Broeder</em></p>\n\n<p>By
    sharing infrastructure resources we gain considerable advantages:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>(1)
    scaling advantage: increasing the potential use and impact of (expensive) datasets
    and maximizing the investment needed for developing services and</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>(2)
    offering SSH researchers new choices and opportunities with regards to data creation
    and analysis.&nbsp;</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This concerns not only newly created
    services and datasets, e.g. the SSH Open Marketplace, but also existing resources
    which were prepared to serve a wider audience. Within the SSHOC project, a couple
    of services originally developed for the CLARIN community were generalised to
    address additional user scenarios and provide new functionalities. Recommendations
    and tools for creating and managing SSH vocabularies were aligned through an SSH
    Vocabulary Commons initiative. SSHOC also provided an opportunity for new and
    emerging communities to discover and investigate what and how already established
    communities have arranged their infrastructure and what is useful for them.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Data
    Repository/Service Certification</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>Mari Kleemola</em></p>\n\n<p>FAIR
    data (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) is essential for the success
    of the EOSC but demand for high quality and FAIR data and metadata is global.
    However, the FAIR principles do not take into account the inevitable changes in
    the data environment and in the needs of data users. Any digital system that accepts,
    stores and provides access to data can be termed a &#39;digital repository&#39;
    in the broadest sense. Only an organisation that meets clear criteria, including
    the provision of active long-term preservation measures for a designated community,
    can be termed a &ldquo;trustworthy digital repository&rdquo;. Trustworthy digital
    repositories play a key role in enabling data to become and remain FAIR over time
    within all disciplines, including SSH. Reaching FAIRness and Trustworthiness is
    a journey that requires expertise, investment and cooperation. Many actors and
    multiple tiers of data storage, protection and preservation are needed to address
    the long tail of at-risk data and metadata. Setting standards and pass/fail criteria
    is not sufficient; compliance with trustworthiness standards is best supported
    by community efforts such as repository certification through CoreTrustSeal, existing
    coordination networks for digital repositories in disciplinary contexts and other
    global, regional and national networks.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Technology and Services</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>Carsten
    Thiel&nbsp;</em></p>\n\n<p>Research Infrastructures are increasingly digital,
    providing virtual access to resources at physical places like libraries and archives.
    Developing the technology that makes this possible is a fundamental part of building
    modern infrastructures and enabling interdisciplinary research requires interoperability
    on the technical level. But delivering added value to the researcher requires
    more than bare technology. In collaboration across disciplines, both within the
    SSHOC project and the wider EOSC landscape, the focus has shifted towards the
    service layer, combining tools with training and support into a complete package
    that addresses end user needs. As domain infrastructures, CESSDA, CLARIN and DARIAH
    are uniquely positioned between researchers, resources and tools to process them
    in order to sustainably ensure open research.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EOSC FUTURE &ndash;
    Connecting Scientific Projects to EOSC Core Services</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>Sally
    Chambers</em></p>\n\n<p>To connect thematic services to the EOSC basic agnostic
    components are needed. The EOSC Architecture provides the so-called EOSC-Core
    layer offering fundamental building blocks such as an AAI (Authentication and
    Authorization Infrastructure), Helpdesk and Monitoring. By easily integrating
    these core services, science projects benefit from an interoperable and more stable
    infrastructural environment. The domain-oriented cluster projects are at the crossroads
    between agnostic service providers and research communities to overcome the &quot;last
    mile challenge&quot; (Koureas, 2016) and build mid-level tools and platforms that
    serve the needs of individual&nbsp; research communities (Lamanna, 2021).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Bibliography</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Blanke,

  title: Closing the knowledge-action gap in conservation with open science
  description: |-
    <p><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
    The knowledge-action gap in conservation science and practice occurs when research outputs do not result in actions to protect or restore biodiversity. Among the diverse and complex reasons for this gap, three barriers are fundamental: knowledge is often unavailable to practitioners and challenging to interpret or difficult to use or both. Problems of availability, interpretability, and useability are solvable with open science practices. We considered the benefits and challenges of three open science practices for use by conservation scientists and practitioners. First, open access publishing makes the scientific literature available to all. Second, open materials (detailed methods, data, code, and software) increase the transparency and use of research findings. Third, open education resources allow conservation scientists and practitioners to acquire the skills needed to use research outputs. The long-term adoption of open science practices would help researchers and practitioners achieve conservation goals more quickly and efficiently and reduce inequities in information sharing. However, short-term costs for individual researchers (insufficient institutional<br>
    incentives to engage in open science and knowledge mobilization) remain a challenge. We caution against a passive approach to sharing that simply involves making information available. We advocate a proactive stance toward transparency, communication, collaboration, and capacity building that involves seeking out and engaging with potential users to maximize the environmental and societal impact of conservation science.</p>

  title: 8.1 Collaboration at International, National and Institutional Level is Vital
    in Fostering Open Science
  description: |-
    <p>Open science and research are a continuum from local to global, from individuals to culture. Models for openness include rich dialogue and wide participation. To ensure replicability and openness, jointly-funded research environments, support services and results will be made widely and equally available to research communities that are guided by agreed policies, principles and contracts of openness.</p>

    <p>The focus of the paper is on the Finnish Open Science and Research initiative, and on LIBER&rsquo;s activities related to Open Science, on the responsibilities and measures through which the various parties can promote openness and collaborate.</p>

    <p>To stimulate the research system in Finland towards better competitiveness and higher quality, Finland&rsquo;s strategy and roadmap for research infrastructures 2014&ndash;20 was developed. The research system needs structures and working methods for openness to be extensively harnessed. The roadmap chimes with the Open Science initiative. The research process and research infrastructures will be based on skilled people, in their ability successfully to design and manage the life cycle, and the quality of research results. Science and research will be on a firm footing when results are widely available and reliably preserved. In managing the life cycle of research results, libraries could take an important role. This role includes facilitating increased expertise by focused education, by expertise in metadata, identifiers and other data structures, support for the publication process and in the provision of related services.</p>

    <p>Through active advocacy work and EU project management, LIBER has gained a role in the development of research infrastructures and in the discussion of strategic directions for Open Science. It is part of LIBER&rsquo;s agenda to support its libraries to become central points of contact for researchers and faculties in the area of scholarly publishing and research data management at institutional level for all academic disciplines.</p>

    <p>The EU projects have provided LIBER libraries with opportunities to participate in many European projects developing policies related to Open Access, infrastructures and to raise awareness. LIBER has also been active in advocating the need for reform of the legal framework, especially that relating to text and data mining (TDM) and copyright. The Finnish national initiative and the activities of LIBER create mutual added value through dialogue and joint project activities.</p>

    <p><strong>Kristiina Hormia-Poutanen</strong>&nbsp;is Director of Library Network Services in The National Library of Finland. The department is responsible for the coordination of national library infrastructure services for Finnish libraries, including coordination of consortia activities, library systems management and development, national licensing and development of the digital library for libraries, archives and museums in Finland, as well as the national ontology service. All Finnish universities, universities of applied sciences, many research institutes, all public libraries, Finnish museums and archives are customers of the National Library. In the Finnish research infrastructure evaluations in 2008 and 2013, two of the services in production today were selected for the research infrastructure roadmap: the National Electronic Library, FinELib; and the National Digital Library user interface, Finna (finna.fi). The period for the updated research infrastructure roadmap is 2014&ndash;20. She has been President of LIBER since 2014 and was Vice-President 2010&ndash;14. She is a member of LIBER&rsquo;s Steering Committee on Scholarly Communication and Research Infrastructures; and a member of the Europeana Board and the Europeana Executive Committee. She is a member of the Open Science Finland strategy group, the National Digital Library Steering Group and the ICT Management Steering Group for the Ministry of Education and Culture (OpIT), which the Ministry of Education and Culture nominates. She is also member of the Public Interface consortium group and the National Ontology (finto.fi). She is also active internationally in IFLA, ICOLC and eIFL, and in international co-operation on digital library infrastructures, cross-domain cooperation, consortia development issues, licensing and licensing models, open access and open data questions as well as development of easy access methods to electronic resources.</p>

  title: 'OpenAIRE Research Graph: Unlocking Open Science Monitoring'
  description: <p>The purpose of the European OpenAIRE infrastructure is to facilitate,
    foster, support, and monitor Open Science scholarly communication in Europe. The
    infrastructure has been operational for almost a decade and successful in linking
    people, ideas and resources in support of the free flow, access, sharing, and
    re-use of research outcomes. Thanks to synergies and collaborations with a plethora
    of scholarly communication stakeholders, including institutional repositories,

  title: OPEN EDUCATIONAL PRACTICES BASED ON MOOC
  description: |-
    <p>The purpose of this book is to express the best classification practices of participants participating in the development of educational technology in choosing open educational resources. The qualitative approach approached the present study. With qualitative exploratory research, of review of self-assessment instruments completed by the participants was carried out. Classifying practices for Open Educational Resources selection was formed to describe the contributions published in the course forums and the participants&#39; tasks concerning the Open Educational Resources topic. It concluded that the usual thing is to make a self-assessment of the resource before using it or to consult with colleagues. It highlighted that these resource&#39;s search carried out with the Google Chrome browser&#39;s help in digital magazines and institutional databases. Also, the need for better management of Open Educational Resources highlighted for generating more skills for their search and selection.<br>

  title: Promoting Open Science Through Collaborative Learning. The MOOC "Science
    2.0 and Open Research Methods"
  description: |-
    <p>This paper examines the MOVING MOOC &ldquo;Science 2.0 and open research methods&rdquo;, an online course for open science developed and conducted at the Media Centre at TU Dresden. The MOOC (massive open online course) is intended to fill a current gap in the scientific methods training for young scholars in institutions of higher education. Digitization and the international and interdisciplinary opening of science in the 21st century require a new set of meta-competencies for young researchers to thrive in this environment. Scientific Communication and collaboration are depending more and more on digital tools and online environments. The term Science 2.0 refers to the targeted use of social media, participative web technologies and online communities in scientific practice. Science 2.0 is closely linked to the concept of Open Science, which aims to remove barriers that restrict access to scientific data and knowledge.<br>
    In the MOOC, young scientists get an introduction to open research methods and learn to use social web technologies and online communities as research tools: to build networks, discuss findings and collaborate with scientists across disciplinary, cultural and geographical boundaries. Open Science means the opening of scientific research processes facilitated by digitization and the proliferation of social web technologies. It is an umbrella term that encompasses technological, pragmatic and normative dimensions (Fecher &amp; Friesike 2014). New research infrastructures like the European Open Science Cloud<br>
    1 or the Open Science Framework2 are being created to support researchers in information discovery, scientific collaboration and communication and in sharing their research outputs early and openly. Making science more open and collaborative has far reaching implications for the whole research cycle: from generating ideas, collecting data and collaborating in research teams to publishing research papers or other research products like code, data and methods. Social technologies such as blogs, wikis and social bookmarking services in combination with movements such as Creative Commons offer completely new opportunities to publish, share, discuss and reproduce scientific findings and data. And movements such as Open Data, Open Access or Open Educational Resources regard free access to knowledge as a normative prerequisite for the development of humanity and question the institutional power of profit-oriented publishers for scientific journals and data, which often keep research results behind a paywall.<br>
    However, despite the many advantages that digital technologies and open research workflows provide for researchers (see McKiernan et al. 2016) scholars are hesitant to share their research and data early and open their workflows to others. The reason for this reluctance is usually not a general rejection of the concept of open science, but a sense of ambiguity about what exactly open research means and also a lack of skills and competences to effectively use digital tools and collaborative methods. Therefore, training researchers in open research methods and open science workflows is key for the proliferation of open science practices.</p>

  title: '10.1 From Open Access to Open Data: Collaborative Work in the University
    Libraries of Catalonia'
  description: |-
    <p>Since 2014 the university libraries of Catalonia have been working with the Libraries and Documentation Area of the University Services Consortium of Catalonia (CSUC) to support research through a working group (GTSR). The group focuses on open access, institutional and disciplinary repositories, ORCID and the Catalan Research Portal, and since 2015 it has given special priority to research data management (RDM). The aim is to help researchers with projects in the Horizon 2020 programme to meet the requirements of the Open Research Data Pilot, because the amount of European funds obtained for university projects is significant and shows a positive trend.</p>

    <p>The starting point for work on RDM was the completion of a specific course for library staff and a prospective survey sent to researchers from the participating universities with H2020-funded projects. The survey confirmed the lack of knowledge of data management among researchers and the GTSR has therefore focused in the last year on three main areas: providing support for the drafting of data management plans (DMPs), making recommendations on data repositories, and drafting a framework agreement for a policy on open access to research data.</p>

    <p>For the support in the drafting of DMPs, we developed a guide on what a DMP should include according to the guidelines of the H2020 framework programme, which includes the FAIR principles and is accompanied by selected examples from several real DMPs. This guide is available in text format and is included in the online tool &ldquo;Research Data Management Plan&rdquo; (www.dmp.csuc.cat), an adaptation of the DMPOnline tool of the Digital Curation Centre.</p>

    <p>Pending evaluation of the possibility of creating a consortial data repository, we have created recommendations to support researchers in selecting a repository for their research data. The document provides sources for consulting disciplinary repositories (directories, publishers&rsquo; recommendations, etc.) and information on multidisciplinary repositories (a comparative table showing the type of data allowed, the file size, the associated licenses, the cost of depositing, etc.)</p>

    <p>Finally, we developed a framework agreement for open access to research data supported by the vice-rectors for Research of the Universities of Catalonia, who have agreed to adopt policies at their universities within a year.</p>

    <p>The RDM support services at each university have begun to offer advice on developing a DMP, selecting a subject or institutional repository, copyright, licences and citing data. The services also offer training and carry out activities aimed at raising awareness among the academic community. All these actions are now being monitored.</p>

  title: 'Open science for enabling reproducible, ethical and collaborative research:
    Insights from The Turing Way'
  description: |-
    <p><strong>Closing message: </strong><em>&quot;Many facets of open science should not be taken as restriction or distraction, but as scientific freedom. You can learn, unlearn, challenge, dismantle and rebuild research infrastructure that prioritises reproducible, ethical and collaborative research for collective benefit. Through radical imagination let open science be your superpower.&quot;</em></p>

    <p><br>
    In this talk, I discuss open science as a framework to ensure that all our research components can be easily accessed, openly examined and built upon by others. I will introduce <em>The Turing Way </em>- an open source, open collaboration and community-driven guide to reproducible, ethical and inclusive data science and research. Drawing insights from the project, I share best practices that researchers should integrate to ensure the highest reproducible and ethical standards from the start of their projects so that their research work is easy to reuse and reproduce at all stages of the development. All attendees will leave the talk understanding the many dimensions of openness and how they can participate in an inclusive, kind and inspiring open source ecosystem as they collaboratively seek to improve research culture.

  title: 'From Open Access to Open Data: Collaborative Work in the University Libraries
    of Catalonia'
  description: |-
    <p>In the last years, the scientific community and funding bodies have paid attention to collected, generated or used data throughout&nbsp;different research activities. The dissemination of these data becomes one of the constituent elements of Open Science. For this&nbsp;reason, many funders are requiring or promoting the development of Data Management Plans, and depositing open data following the&nbsp;FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable). Libraries and research offices of Catalan universities &ndash;which co-ordinately work within the Open Science Area of CSUC&ndash; offer support services to research data management. The different works carried out at the Consortium level will be presented, as well the implementation of the service in each university.</p>

  title: 'LIBSENSE: Pan-African Library/NREN Collaborations around Open Science at
    the Institutional, National and Regional Levels'
  description: |-
    <p>LIBSENSE is a Pan-African initiative instituted in 2017 to foster Library/NREN collaboration to provide digital services for African libraries, specifically, those in research and higher education and particularly around Open Science. After a successful pan-African survey and workshop series in AfricaConnect2, founding members WACREN, Ubuntunet Alliance and ASREN, in collaboration with three other core partners (COAR, EIFL and University of Sheffield Information School) are undertaking new activities in 2020-2021. In order to strengthen and stimulate action under its 3 pillars of infrastructure support, capacity-building and policy development, LIBSENSE in AfricaConnect3 has instituted a number of working groups, namely: Infrastructure - open access journals, repositories for publications and data, and open discovery services; Policies - open science policies, governance and leadership; Capacity Building - communities of practice and training; and region-specific and language-specific initiatives - Arabic (North Africa) and French (West and Central Africa).<br>
    LIBSENSE envisages these activities to form part of a sustainable framework for engaging with open science at institutional, national, regional and eventually continental levels. Rather than top-down imposition of policies and principles, this initiative focuses on contingent, bottom-up and grassroots programmes of action initiated by its community. Examples are 12 workshops under capacity-building endeavours, with two focusing on skills development and the others on open access publishing, research data repositories and repository interoperability, persistent Identifiers, engagement with faculty and support and training.<br>
    As part of policy development, LIBSENSE has also engaged with the UNESCO Open Science Partnership and adopted Open Science Africa: Principles and Actions for Global Participation. Furthermore, LIBSENSE are also developing National Open Science Roadmaps including policies, infrastructure, and capacities in pilot African countries and at the institutional level, targeted workshops for the executive leadership of HE institutions and policy-makers across Africa. On the infrastructure side, plans are also underway to develop shared platforms at the national level.</p>

    data and software are valuable contributions to the scientific record along with
    papers, methods, and more. As we seek to make research more accessible through
    Open Access initiatives, we should also promote the importance of making the data
    and software that support our research more transparent and connected. Well-documented
    data and software that can be discovered separately from the paper and is preserved
    in a FAIR-aligned repository helps to provide what is needed to evaluate and replicate
    research. Data and relevant software should be cited in the paper&rsquo;s reference
    section to allow for automated attribution and credit as its own research output.
    These citations allow for linking with the paper when persistent identifiers are
    used. In our work at the American Geophysical Union and with our broad international
    Earth, space, and environmental sciences community, we have put into place journal
    policies requiring that data and relevant software be described in the availability
    statement, and cited in the references. As conveners of the Enabling FAIR Data
    project (https://copdess.org/enabling-fair-data-project/enabling-fair-project-overview/)
    that includes over 500 international stakeholders and signatories, we continue
    to work with publishers and data repositories to put into place the practices
    needed to ensure all research data are discoverable and well-documented supporting
    the FAIR principles. We have made good progress, and in this talk will share the
    current status and focus areas of our work. Open and FAIR data and software as
    a goal requires everyone in the research community to participate. We encourage
    you to start or continue your journey towards making open and FAIR data and software
    part of our research culture.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Resources</strong></p>\n\n<p><a

  title: Open Access Student Event  - The game of Open Access
  description: |-
    <p>During the Open Access Week 2021 of the University of Antwerp, a team of students , with the support of the staff of the University of Antwerp, set up a &ldquo;Open Access Student Event&rdquo;&nbsp; The purpose of the project is to raise awareness of Open Access and Open Science discussions and practices among (under)graduate students. In order to make this experience more enjoyable , we decided to discuss this topic by playing a board game. We adapted previous versions of &quot;The game of Open Access&quot; to the context of the University of Antwerp. The workshop was held in 29-10-2021 as a pilot. We plan to expand it to other campuses and faculties in the upcoming Open Access Weeks. We are making the digital files of the game available under at Zenodo in the hope that other institutions will be interested in reusing them and adapting them to other contexts. Work is available under a CC-BY-NC 4.0 license.<br>

  title: Supercharging Research with Open Data Science and Teamwork
  description: |-
    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Despite supporting the idea of open science, researchers may not participate because it is unclear how to implement it in their own work. At the same time, they are struggling with data analysis, which without formal training becomes an individual, slow, and lonely burden. There is great opportunity to welcome scientists to existing open data science tools and communities that can meet their immediate needs and also catalyze a more open culture in science. Openscapes does this by engaging, empowering, and amplifying scientists with open data science, focused on establishing open mindsets and resilient, collaborative data practices within research teams (Lowndes et al. 2019, Nature; openscapes.org). Building on experiences from the Ocean Health Index and the Openscapes Champions program, I will discuss how open science is at the core of working towards better and kinder science in less time, together.</p>

  title: Open Science Partnerships' contribution to knowledge dissemination and value
    creation
  description: |-
    <p>The translation of scientific discoveries into beneficial applications and wealth for society endures as a major policy objective of governments and academic institutions. Universities&rsquo; institutional adaptation is taking place primarily through a broader spectrum of measures to boost innovation and societal impact of research, which includes the promotion of open collaborative practices for the production, dissemination and valorisation of scientific knowledge. OSPs seem to offer a promising supplement for the generation of relevant outcomes as they enable the engagement of non-academic stakeholders in the processes of value creation and knowledge dissemination, which become fundamental tools to find further applications for inventions.</p>

    <p>Openness appears in this context as an emerging transversal dynamic that is re-shaping science and innovation through a diverse array of processes, infrastructures and practices. The SGC and ODIN case studies show that ‒irrespective of their different features and scales‒ open collaborative processes result in cross-fertilization of knowledge and technologies that may enhance the competitive position of partners, e.g. either in terms of high-quality reproducible science for academic researchers or in-house building capacity for further R&amp;D of firms. Likewise, diverse open exchanges between the academia and industry, ‒including know-how, data, training or testing‒ are helping to foster cross-boundary knowledge flows based on the complementary expertise of participants. The two observed OSP reflect partners&rsquo; strategic needs for high-risk projects in drug discovery to be grounded on novel combinations of the stakeholders&rsquo; knowledge base. Besides, interviews confirmed that the OSP experience seems to push the participants towards both more flexible managing practices within the partnership and mutual adaptation techniques as part of the learning process.</p>

    <p>Unlike traditional linear models, an OSP collaborative platform is not necessarily university-led; instead, multiple actors mobilise resources and capabilities in a fluid and interactive manner to generate value from research. More distributed leadership in knowledge production and dissemination may, therefore, enable academic institutions to account for additional nuances and complexities involved in technology transfer and commercialization processes. Within the emerging diversification strategies of universities, OSPs illustrate a type of intervention that seems better aligned with the stage heterogeneity of technology development cycles, which potentially strengthen the basis for identifying wide-ranging opportunities, like the SGC case indicates.</p>

    <p>In addition to industry uptake of research outputs and the creation of private-held companies, SGC also inspired the launching of a public interest open science company owned by a registered charity. This company coordinates drug discovery projects in specific therapeutic areas, with the participation of a university lab, to provide services to the scientific community, the healthcare systems and other agents. The combination of open science principles with commercial incentives based on regulatory IP assets&nbsp;seem to&nbsp;suggest arising mixed forms of valorisation of science.</p>

    <p>From a policy perspective, our results show how, in response to a changing landscape, academic institutions expand their boundary spanning strategies with their participation in interdependent knowledge networks to fuel innovation, while also furthering understanding of imperative societal challenges. Fostered personal relations between scientists and industry have proved to be of critical importance for this function as bridging organizations. Nevertheless, open collaboration practices may also represent some managerial challenges, notably in terms of coordinated contributions and a shared innovation agenda.</p>

    <p>This lesson should provide data scientists with the knowledge and tools necessary to apply their new skill set immediately to collaborate with other scientists in any project. In the beginning, the workshop will introduce open science practices. It will then describe how to develop and collaborate on code with another scientist, keep code synchronised, and solve conflicts that arise from that collaboration, licencing their works and making it citable.</p>

  title: Why Open Science?
  description: |-
    <p>Scientific reproducibility and Open Science may seem like a &ldquo;new&quot; approach to Science, but these concepts are in fact fundamental principles of the Scientific Method, established a thousand years ago.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>By definition, scientists want to follow the Scientific Method.&nbsp;Then why have different studies demonstrated that researchers have difficulties reproducing even their own methods?&nbsp;Clues can be found in a system where science is being drowned by numerical ranking, favouring productivity over discovery. Given the current epoch of economic crisis, where researchers are forced into a competitive game of pandering to panelists in quests for funds, it seems to be a good time for deep reflection on the entire scientific system, and on how to support good ideas versus good marketing.</p>

    <p>The challenge will be harder when facilities like the Square Kilometre Array Observatory start generating data volumes reaching the exa-scale. Not only will computing, networking or storage resources reach their limits, but the biggest challenge will be scientific: Extracting knowledge will become an impossible task without a fundamental change in methodology and policies in the short-term. Computing facilities enabling science in Big Data oriented facilities should be key in supporting astronomers to build reproducible methods.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>I will discuss how different research communities (such as individual researchers, large collaborations, data centres, journals and their referees) as well as policy makers, view the challenges/barriers and rewards of reproducibility.&nbsp;For scientific facilities, adoption of Open Science is both a need and a duty. Open Science not only enhances scientific collaboration and knowledge interchange in a transparent way. It also brings a wider impact in other areas, by encouraging the democratisation of science, contributing to achieving UN&rsquo;s Sustainable Development Goals.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>With this talk I aim to provoke extra critical thinking among the different actors involved in our system (applicants for jobs/grants, &nbsp;referees, or evaluators), while trying to discuss state of the art and possible future tools and metrics in order to&nbsp;empower scientists to achieve reproducibility in their work. The end game should not be &quot;good&quot; science but just Science, the one that follows the Scientific Method.</p>

  title: Making plasma science more open, collaborative, and reproducible
  description: <p>The reproducibility crisis of modern science is the inability of
    scientists to reproduce roughly half of the results published in scientific journals.
    This crisis has affected a broad range of fields, such as psychology, chemistry,
    and oncology. While physicists tend to have high confidence that physics research
    is reproducible, no comprehensive studies have been performed to support or refute
    this claim. Nevertheless, the scientific, cultural, and institutional practices
    that contribute to the reproducibility crisis in other fields are also present
    in plasma science. This tutorial will describe how to implement best practices
    for scientific reproducibility into plasma research. The talk will begin by outlining
    sources of irreproducibility, such as cognitive biases, improper use of statistics,
    publication bias, closed access policies for data and software, and the reward
    system for modern academia. The talk will then describe remedies for these problems
    such as open access data policies; open metadata standards; open source software;
    training on proper use of statistics; pre-registration of research methodologies;
    independent methodological and statistical support; and valuing the reproducibility
    of research in tenure, hiring, and funding decisions.</p>

  title: Digital economy for Open Science
  description: "<p>Open Science is the practice of science in such a way that others
    can collaborate and<br>\ncontribute, where research data, lab notes, and other
    research processes are freely available,<br>\nunder terms that enable reuse, redistribution,
    and reproduction of the research and its<br>\nunderlying data and methods.</p>\n\n<p>The
    transition to Open Science is challenging and will need to be facilitated by focused
    and<br>\nunited efforts of major stakeholders in science, and a more flexible
    research publishing system,<br>\nas well as new incentives and rewarding mechanisms.</p>\n\n<p>Currently,
    all steps of the scientific discovery process use inert business models that lead
    to the<br>\nfollowing issues among others:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>The conflict of
    interests between major science publishers and the research community. Consequently,
    paywalls and monopoly of publishers block scientific progress.</li>\n\t<li>Negative
    results are published with a low impact factor which leads to losing both the
    time and resources of researchers pursuing the repetition of findings.</li>\n\t<li>Reproducibility

    establishes a new digital economy for open science, where rewards are based on<br>\nthe
    contribution to the scientific discovery and impact of innovation. It allows to

    of scientific research and<br>\ninnovation. And, through its openness and accessibility,
    it provides scientists and researchers<br>\nwith the collaborative environment
    for financing, conducting, reviewing, publishing and reusing<br>\nresearch.</p>\n\n<p>The
    first implementation of the protocol is set to be officially launched in 2020,

  title: 'Open Data in Slovenia: An Assessment of Accountability among Stakeholders'
  description: Social science data archives (ADP) hold a project with the short title
    'Open data'. The goal is to articulate a general strategy of open research data
    access in Slovenia, in all scientific disciplines and in accordance with OECD
    principles. In order to assess the initial conditions in the area of data handling
    in a country we conducted a series of half-structured interviews with different
    target stakeholders. The emphasis was on stories about the problems foreseen in
    open data access, and about suggested solutions to overcome barriers. We would
    like to present results of that preliminary study. The questions were about the
    accountability and mutual expectations of various stakeholders such as data creators
    and users, specialised services (e.g. research libraries) and policymakers. We
    inquired about the existence of specialised competencies, and need for collaboration
    of different professional communities. Comparison with studies about situations
    in other countries shows prevailing similarity. Slovene scientific community expressed
    high level of awareness about best practices in data handling that steam from
    intensive international cooperation. Concern was expressed about the lack of policy
    of incentives to motivate additional data exchange, and little support infrastructure,
    together with the need to develop additional competencies in information service
    oriented activities.

  title: Case studies on Open Science in the context of ERC projects - Set 5
  description: "<p>This document presents the fifth of five sets of case studies that
    have been produced in the framework of the <em>&lsquo;Study on open access to
    publications and research data management and sharing within ERC projects&rsquo;.
    </em>This study has been procured by the ERC Executive Agency under contract number
    ERCEA/A1/2016/06.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The following three case studies are included
    in this set:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Repression and the Escalation of Conflict (RATE)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The
    <a href=\"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/111262_en.html\">RATE</a> project,
    led by Professor Sabine Carey at the University of Mannheim, sheds light on the
    relationship between killings of journalists and political repression. This data-rich
    and empirically based political science research builds on a variety of existing
    data sources. Some are the product of the research team&rsquo;s previous research,
    and some are gathered from media sources. The project is generating fresh data
    from these and from newly collected surveys and interviews. Professor Carey&rsquo;s
    team has produced online resources based on these, and deposited datasets and
    code in open repositories. Open sharing of their novel reference datasets has
    spawned new lines of enquiry for the research team, and for the broader political
    science community, into pro-government militias and their influence on levels
    of political violence.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Translational and Transdisciplinary
    research in Modeling Infectious Diseases (TransMID)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/205319_en.html\">TransMID</a>
    project is consolidating recent work in infectious disease modelling that employs
    social contact data to analyse patterns in disease transmission. By extensively
    collecting and reusing social contact data from previous studies, Professor Niel
    Hens at the University of Hasselt is finding the key parameters for modelling
    across these datasets. This should better equip epidemiologists to assist public
    health agencies in responding to epidemics. Researchers need to share their data
    more often for that to happen. Hens and his collaborators offer their community
    an example by sharing datasets, including their own results, as publicly and quickly
    as possible. In doing so the team gains impact for TransMID outputs and, by collaborating
    in data analysis tool development, Hens and his colleagues are laying the ground
    for others in the field to benefit. The potential is threefold; firstly, data
    sharers can more readily enhance the reusability of their datasets by describing
    the data collection context using common parameters that TransMID has found through
    systematic analysis of previous studies. Secondly, the datasets described by these
    parameters are used by TransMID as raw material for the development of software
    tools that enable new systematic analyses. Thirdly, researchers can more readily
    deal with ethical questions by learning how TransMID addresses them.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Evolutionary
    reconstruction of viral spread in time and space (VIRALPHYLOGEOGRAPHY)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>A
    detailed characterisation of pathogen spread in space and time is crucial for
    epidemiologists to identify the causal mechanisms leading to disease emergence,
    epidemic expansion and endemic maintenance. The project <a href=\"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/96279_en.html\">VIRALPHYLOGEOGRAPHY</a>,
    led by Associate Professor Philippe Lemey at KU Leuven aimed to reconstruct the
    way viruses spread through time and space. While investigating how genetic variation
    within viral pathogens, such as influenza, Ebola and HIV, emerges and persists
    in various different hosts and environments, Lemey and his team developed a comprehensive
    statistical framework for uncovering the spatial and temporal dynamics of pathogen
    genomes. For their research, the team adopted an approach that promotes openness
    and transparency. As the project&rsquo;s results can directly impact epidemic
    emergency responses, they favoured open-source research tools as well as open
    sharing of research methods and outputs.</p>"

    <p><strong>2019-11 Script Open Science Seachange</strong></p>

    <p><strong>What do we mean when we talk about Open Science. I have one short answer to that:</strong></p>

    <p><strong>[CLICK]</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Open Science means a seachange in research! I will support my answer with 6 perspectives and a set of conclusions. I try to leave 5 minutes for questions. Please feel invited!</strong></p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>Here is the agenda of my presentation.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>We will cover the context, definitions, examples of OS across sectors, the matter of sustainability, some fresh perspectives (The Gestalt and The Hazards) and we will look into the deep roots of the Open Science transformation.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>First to start: the context and the definitions</strong></p>

    <p><strong>---</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Meet Prof. Steve Mann from Toronto. He coining the term Open Science, back in 1998.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>In one of his articles about Surveillance, Sousveillance, and Metaveillance, Prof. Mann says:</strong></p>

    <p><strong>[CLICK] &ldquo;Science is a human endeavour in which we attempt to go wherever the truth may lead us, in pursuit of new discoveries&ldquo;. The term OpenScience was coined by him to emphasize this need for truth and open disclosure &hellip; &bdquo;and if surveillance cannot deliver on that promise, we need to look at other veillances!&ldquo; &ndash; he said and came up with the idea of Open Science.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Among others, Steve Mann has been recognized as &ldquo;the father of wearable computing&rdquo; and &ldquo;the father of wearable augmented reality.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>---</strong></p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>Are you familiar with the Reproducibility Crisis?</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Nature published a study in 2016 showing that more than 70% of researchers have tried and failed to reproduce another scientist&#39;s experiments, and more than half have failed to reproduce their own experiments. These are the figures of surveying over 1,500 researchers.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>---</strong></p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>What is the cause of this crisis?</strong></p>

    <p><strong>More than 60% of respondents said that the pressure to publish and the selective reporting are the most important factors.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>If we look closer, we see that these 2 reasons are further confirmed by [CLICK] 2 other reasons which are closely related to them: row data being unavailable and the insufficient peer review.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>I share the opinion of some academics that all these factors are intensified by common forces: competition for grants and positions, and a growing burden of bureaucracy for researchers.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>For many, this was the main reason to open science. It is very IMPORTANT to have in mind this CONTEXT!</strong></p>

    <p><strong>----</strong></p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>Open Science Definition? it seems we can never run out of many! Here is just a hand of them which I could grab in minute of desk research.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>No matter we speak about The European Open Science Monitor, FOSTER Taxonomy, OSPP ambitions, Centre for Open Science wheel or Open Science Mushroom, everybody claims a definition.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>But it shouldn&#39;t bother us! Since &rdquo;Science&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t have a universal definition, why should we try to have one for Open Science?</strong></p>

    <p><strong>So, let&rsquo;s celebrate the diversity! [CLICK]</strong></p>

    <p><strong>I favour a definition, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean I exclude the others.&nbsp;</strong></p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>---</strong></p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>Let&lsquo;s examine now how public research is doing in this landscape.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>----</strong></p>

    <p><strong>How are we doing in Europe?</strong></p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>-----</strong></p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>Here is Europe&lsquo;s top-down approach.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>In 2014, The European Commission ordered public consultations for reforming science.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Right in the introduction of their background document the Commission stated:</strong></p>

    <p><strong>&ldquo;The impact of these trends* (digital technologies, globalisation of research, societal demands for science) is already visible and it addresses some of the most burning issues of science, such as the slowness of the publication process, the increasing criticism of the existing peer review system, and the challenge of reproducing research results due to the lack of available data&ldquo;</strong></p>

    <p><strong>These issues are still burning today.</strong></p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>----</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Open Science long existed in Europe, before 2014.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>However, I find relevant to bring up to you the chronology of the Open Science Policy Platform (OSPP from now on), a high-level expert group that informs EC, European Council and national organisations.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>It started in 2014 with a public consultation</strong></p>

    <p><strong>In 2015: The Competitiveness Council welcomed the development of an Open Science Agenda</strong></p>

    <p><strong>2016, the launch of Open Science Policy Platform (OSPP) by Commissioner Moedas and chaired by Dr. Eva Mendez from Madrid.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>In 2018: OSPP releases their set of guidelines - Integrated Advice of the OSPP - and it receives a new mandate</strong></p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>------</strong></p>

    <p><strong>And here it comes one of my favourite definition of Open Science:</strong></p>

    <p><strong>For OSPP,</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Open Science is scholarly research that is collaborative, transparent and reproducible and whose outputs are publicly available.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>[CLICK] &hellip;. and I stop here. I don&lsquo;t like the rest which suggest that EU is embarking on the Open Science journey to win a competition against the rest of the world.</strong></p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>-----</strong></p>

    <p><strong>What OSPP did? They released in 2018 a set of recommendations for what they identified as &rdquo;The 8 ambitions for Open Science&rdquo;.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>They put these ambitions in the context of some stakeholders, displayed here on the bottom.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>-----</strong></p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>Let me zoom-in:</strong></p>

    <p><strong>these are the 8 ambitions that European Commission set for a cultural and structural change to Open Science.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Each of these ambitions could also be understood as a Strategic Direction for delivering Open Science.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>The European Commission is now sending a clear message to all research communities.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>[CLICK] Press the Open button! Join us in this journey! &hellip;and discover a new world of research.</strong></p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>------</strong></p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>But Europe is moving also bottom-up in its transformation to Open Science.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Here is the example of UK&rsquo;s first fully Open Access Press: UCL Press.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Through their press, they reached over 2.5 million book and journal downloads since launch in June 2015</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Compare this figure with the conventional sales of monographs which reach 300 copies.&ndash; for the most successful titles!</strong></p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>------</strong></p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>I can continue the European examples of Open Science with TU Delft Data Stewards Champions, Leiden&lsquo;s GoFAIR Initiative or the Hungarian EISZ Consortium that negotiated contracts with publishers which now cover over 80% of their needs!</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Open Knowledge Maps re-designs the knowledge discovery service. DOAJ is well known to you. The UK Reproducibility Network tackles the reproducibility crisis.</strong></p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>------</strong></p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>Let&rsquo;s see now how our colleagues are doing over the Atlantic.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>One big difference is that USA doesn&rsquo;t have a federal top-down approach.&nbsp;</strong></p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>------</strong></p>

    <p><br>
    &nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>Therefore, on US front I will start with the Center for Open Science which I appreciate very much. Their definition of Open Science goes straightforward: Show your work! Share your work! Advance Science!</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Their approach is strongly related to the Reproducibility Crises and they believe that the Open Science vision is achievable because</strong></p>

    <p><strong>&bull;openness, integrity, and reproducibility are shared values,</strong></p>

    <p><strong>&bull;the technological capacity is available,</strong></p>

    <p><strong>&bull;and sustainable business models that promote openness exist already.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>[CLICK] The Open Science Framework is a collection of tools that they develop to enable Open Science through all scientific phases, which they represent in this wheel.</strong></p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>-------</strong></p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>The same as Europe, USA is working on multiple fronts of Open Science, almost all of them bottom-up, independent of the federal bodies.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Here is just a small number of other Open Science initiatives in USA:</strong></p>

    <p><strong>1.SciStarter and Arizona State University are accelerating Citizen Science</strong></p>

    <p><strong>2.University of California is taking a leading position and inspires the other US universities how to negotiate with publishers</strong></p>

    <p><strong>3.University of Harvard through their Office for Scholarly Communication is inspiring the world how to reform the contracts that authors sign with publishers.</strong></p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>Open Science at The Neuro (the Montreal Neurological Institute and Hospital) deserves a separate attention!</strong></p>

    <p><strong>In 1934, Dr. Wilder Penfield had the unique vision to advance medicine through patient-centred science. Today, The Neuro continues to lead scientific innovation as the first academic institute&nbsp;to develop and adopt Open Science.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>I only have a few minutes to talk with you today, but if you want to see how an entire academic institution and a hospital is acting completely on an Open Science landscape, please go and visit that link, turn the notifications off on your computer, have something to drink for 2 hours and study!</strong></p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>-------</strong></p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>But is Open Science an apanage for public institutions? Definitely NO. Let&rsquo;s an example!</strong></p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>--------</strong></p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>Open Science is for all: public, private, non-for profit or for-profit research!</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Structural Genomics Consortium is a Public-Private Partnership that was created as a collaboration between academia, public funders and industry - nine big pharma companies!</strong></p>

    <p><strong>They use Open Science methods to enable consistent data and accelerate reliable discoveries!</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Why these institutions started this collaboration? Because all the results, all the tools and molecules developed by SGC are made available for free to anyone willing to work on them. For academics this means new, robust research. Pharma companies benefit because they get the chance to take these new molecules and turn them into successful drugs. Clinicians and patients are motivated by the collaboration as it brings hope for new medicines.&nbsp;</strong></p>

    <p><strong>I have many more example of Open Science existing in private institution. If you are interested, please engage with me!</strong></p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>GESTALT</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Back in Europe, in 2014. Background Document, &rdquo;Science 2.0&rdquo;</strong></p>

    <p><strong>The paper has another important statement which deserves a closer attention. I quote:</strong></p>

    <p><strong>[CLICK]</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Science 2.0&rsquo; is a holistic approach, therefore, is much more than only one of its features (such as Open Access) and represents a paradigm shift in the modus operandi of research and science, impacting the entire scientific process.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>------</strong></p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>Now let&rsquo;s pay a closer attention to the OSPP elements! None of the European ambitions for Open Science are explicitly referring to open methods, or to open outputs.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>For publishing, the ambition is formulated as &ldquo;Future of Scholarly Communication&rdquo;.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Research Data? The corresponding ambition is FAIR Data, and not Open Research Data.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Why?</strong></p>

    <p><strong>I don&rsquo;t know the reason, but for me is clear that the definition is looking to Open Science as a whole, not through individual elements.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>We will most probably have Open Science delivered through a number of elements that are not fully open science on their own.&nbsp;</strong></p>

    <p><strong>-----</strong></p>

    <p><br>
    &nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>As an early element of Open Science, Scholarly communication gave to the world the concept of Open Access.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Let&rsquo;s take a closer look to Future of Scholarly Communication, year 2020</strong></p>

    <p><strong>This image shows a recent metaphor to Open Access. Artists performing a show, apparently opened to the public.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Is it fully open for all?</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Do you see this guy here? He doesn&rsquo;t seem to have the same access to the show as many others. His access is blocked, because of his location (behind a pillar).</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Further on, much better access seems to have those that sit in the first lines of the crowd while certain difficulties to enjoy the show seem to have those sitting far in the back. Their location is not optimal for fully enjoying the show.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>[CLICK]</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Why I present this metaphor? You should know that policymakers are now informally discussing about restricting ability to view open-access journal articles in nations that have not responded with policies to remove paywalls. Our immediate future could be More Open Science, but not necessarily a Complete Open Science.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>The Gestalt of Open Science means achieving Open Science even when not all elements are compliant to a Complete Open Science ideology.</strong></p>

    <p><br>
    &nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>------</strong></p>

    <p><br>
    &nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>Another example for understanding the Gestalt of Open Science stays in the Open Research Data Pilot.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>[CLICK] The Commission was running a flexible pilot under Horizon 2020 called the Open Research Data Pilot (ORD pilot).</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Here is the requirement of this pilot. I quote:</strong></p>

    <p><strong>[CLICK]&nbsp; Participating in the Pilot does not necessarily mean opening up all your research data. Rather, the pilot follows the principle &quot;as open as possible, as closed as necessary&quot; and focuses on encouraging sound data management as an essential part of research best practice.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Again: The Gestalt of Open Science means achieving Open Science even when not all elements are compliant to a Complete Open Science ideology.</strong></p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>-------</strong></p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>So, what Gestalt means? An organized whole that is perceived as more than the sum of its parts</strong></p>

    <p><strong>The Gestalt of Open Science that I want to introduce to you is based on the principles of grouping from Psychology and it means that</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Open Science is a new research system that is more than the sum of its parts. Even if its parts, in their individuality could mean &ldquo;as open as possible, as closed as necessary&rdquo;, the whole (The Open Science) means, in the end, a system that is collaborative, transparent and reproducible and whose outputs are publicly available.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>[CLICK]</strong></p>

    <p><strong>The Gestalt of Open Science is the meta-principle that applies to all definitions of Open Science, no matter if we speak about spinning wheels or mushrooms.</strong></p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>-------</strong></p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>Any responsible person who is promoting Open Science should recognize that we have a spaghetti of Open Science.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>It is delicious, healthy, but hard to tackle.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>That said, it is time to look into the hazards of Open Science.</strong></p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>-----</strong></p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>Like everything else, Open Science is not protected against hazards. These could be, in my view:</strong></p>

    <p><strong>&bull;Its own Failure. If we fail now, we will not have another shot in a foreseen future.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>&bull;To become an exclusive movement of public research that continues to enlarge the disconnection with Society.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>&bull;To associate &rdquo;Open&rdquo; with &rdquo;Ignore&rdquo;, especially when it comes to resources that are needed implement it.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>&bull;To build blocks of &rsquo;net beneficiaries&rsquo; that rarely move to &rsquo;contributors&rsquo; side.</strong></p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>All these hazards are amplified if research organizations want to deliver Open Science as a fashionable set of tools, instead of a cultural change.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>------</strong></p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>Maybe it&rsquo;s good to say what IS NOT Open Science!</strong></p>

    <p><strong>[CLICK]</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Firstly, it is not a sugarcoat for Open Access. Open Science hasn&rsquo;t been invented to make a nice, sweet coat for Open Access. Open Access is only 1 element, in my opinion perfectly equal in importance with all the other elements of Open Science.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>[CLICK]</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Open Science is neither a snake oil. It doesn&rsquo;t promise a cure to all problems in research!</strong></p>

    <p><strong>It only proposes a new set of methods, as an evolution from current good practices and &ndash; possible &ndash; as a way to restrict research biases.</strong></p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>-------</strong></p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>SUSTAINABILITY</strong></p>

    <p><strong>This slide, should probably say everything: Being sustainable is an act of responsibility! It&lsquo;s not a trend, it&lsquo;s not an option, it&lsquo;s not a model. It&lsquo;s a must!</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Keep this in mind for the moment: Sustainability means Responsibility!</strong></p>

    <p><strong>=========</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Never discount this understanding!</strong></p>

    <p><strong>It&lsquo;s a direct relation between these 2 concepts:</strong></p>

    <p><strong>&bull;If you are sustainable, you can take responsibilities.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>&bull;If you are not sustainable, you can&lsquo;t take responsibilities, you cannot offer your services to hold responsibilities.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>&bull;The more sustainable you are, the more responsibilities you can take</strong></p>

    <p><strong>&bull;The less sustainable you are, the fewer responsibilities you take.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>&bull;If you are not sustainable but you go toward that stage, you still can&lsquo;t take responsibilities, but you go toward that position</strong></p>

    <p><strong>We will come back to this understanding!</strong></p>

    <p><strong>-----</strong></p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>When we speak about sustainability in Open Science, we have 2 fundamental questions:</strong></p>

    <p><strong>The first one is what return should expect funders and institutions?</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Why do we want Open Science?</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Please be aware that there are different perspectives to form these expectations. For example, while many libraries think that Open Science is a moral reparation, a lot of funders think differently. Not opposite, but differently: that Open Science is a way to boost the sustainable prosperity. They see Open Science as a way to achieve a better return of their investments.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>[CLICK]</strong></p>

    <p><strong>My idea about the outcome of Open Science is</strong></p>

    <p><strong>&bull;Quality, healthy OS systems</strong></p>

    <p><strong>&bull;Reproducible Science</strong></p>

    <p><strong>&bull;Faster, reliable discoveries</strong></p>

    <p><strong>&bull;Meaningful translational science,</strong></p>

    <p><strong>&bull;Wider dissemination</strong></p>

    <p><strong>&bull;International Collaborations</strong></p>

    <p><strong>&bull;Better education through practice</strong></p>

    <p><strong>&bull;Collective intelligence</strong></p>

    <p><strong>&bull;Man-machine collaborations</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Therefore, funders should make available financial arrangements that allows the organisations to build sustainability for such outcomes.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>-------</strong></p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>The second question is the sustainability for the Open Science tools.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Here are a number of models exploring the sustainability of tools.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>[CLICK] One model is the general idea of community-led efforts. In my example here, the Invest in Open Infrastructure or SCOSS (Sustainability Coalition for Open Science Services).</strong></p>

    <p><strong>[CLICK] Another model is shaped around &bdquo;membership models&ldquo;. Here are the examples.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>[CLICK] Another model is suggesting using the resources that already exist in the system and turn them to support Open Science tools, either as direct spendings or long term investments</strong></p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>------</strong></p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>Sustainability means Responsibility</strong></p>

    <p><strong>If Open Science is a promise for a better research, sustainability is part of the promise.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>[CLICK] On the contrary, building an unsustainable infrastructure or one which is not able to offer a Service Level Agreement is an act of irresponsibility!</strong></p>

    <p><strong>It&lsquo;s typical for groups and communities that don&lsquo;t take accountability for their own actions.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Our community should not act like that!</strong></p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>------</strong></p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>Here is the root for many: The Research Metrics!</strong></p>

    <p><strong>It is well known the fact that research organisations are struggling to re-design their metrics in order to measure their activity more eloquently, to measure their impact in society and move away from a system that puts too much weight on publications.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>A matrix of metrics is proposed by Prof. Bernard Rentier, Rector Emeritus of University of Liege (Belgium).</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Again, I don&lsquo;t have enough time to insist on this but,</strong></p>

    <p><strong>[CLICK]</strong></p>

    <p><strong>If you find useful Prof. Rentier&rsquo;s ideas and assessment framework, I suggest you read his book Open Science, The Challenge of Transparency published at Acad&eacute;mie royale de Belgique in March 2019.</strong></p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>------</strong></p>

    <p><strong>What looks strange to me, is why there is not enough action to align these new metrics with the SDG indicators!</strong></p>

    <p><strong>[CLICK]</strong></p>

    <p><strong>There are 232 well-defined SDG Indicators published on the UN web-page.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Why there are no notable efforts to design a series of research metrics that are aligned with the global SGD effort?</strong></p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>------</strong></p>

    <p><br>
    &nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>Are the new metrics indeed, the deep root of Open Science? I have a little doubt about that&hellip;.I have a feeling that is something deeper in the ground&hellip;.Maybe less visible, but essential, like the moisture and the minerals in soil.</strong></p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>------</strong></p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>Perhaps an anonymous academic writer could shed some light into the dark.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>This is one of 2 articles published in The Guardian in 2018 which could serve as an example to what it means to be exclusively driven by just 1 set of principles for nurturing discoveries, innovations and inventions: the mighty principles of Competition.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>This exclusive set of principles apparently guides the current research methods and builds a strange behaviour for researchers: they need to be the first, they want to be the first, they must keep their work secret!</strong></p>

    <p><strong>It&lsquo;s not here the place to examine that article, but I linked my slides to it, so that you can read it. Please engage with me after your reading!</strong></p>

    <p><strong>-----</strong></p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>And this is a second article published in the Guardian, not long after the anonymous article.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>For Margaret Heffernan, a well-known entrepreneur and author, the injection of competition into higher education has been dangerous: &ldquo;Students compete for places and grades, academics compete for jobs, publication spaces and funding. Everyone is being ranked everywhere.&rdquo;</strong></p>

    <p><strong>&ldquo;This is what happens when you put systems under competitive pressure,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Winning becomes so important that if you can&rsquo;t win the right way, you find other ways.&nbsp;</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Rankings are particularly pernicious in Heffernan&rsquo;s eyes. Leaders determined to improve in rankings absorb an external set of values rather than creating their own definition of success.</strong></p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>-----</strong></p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>Indeed: when you compete, you measure your success by someone else&#39;s definition of it. When you collaborate, you achieve meaningful, transformative results.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>-------</strong></p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>The game-changer for Open Science is a set of metrics that rewards the Collaboration</strong></p>

    <p><strong>[CLICK]</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Not only for measuring how much open is your work, but also what collaboration potential is offered through the built-in connectors.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>------</strong></p>

    <p><br>
    &nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>Nothing from what I say means that I am against the competition.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Competition is good, in a context of Collaboration!</strong></p>

    <p><strong>------</strong></p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>

    <p><strong>First: we need an &bdquo;open&ldquo; system that builds research communities instead of research machines,</strong></p>

    <p><strong>A system that measures both our ability to compete and to collaborate.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>-----</strong></p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>Second: without rewards for collaboration in research, Open Science is less vibrant, disadvantaged and a reversible movement.&nbsp;</strong></p>

    <p><strong>-----</strong></p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>Third: The goals for Open Science should exceed the academic environment and they should refer directly to the benefits of our society.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>[CLICK] British people say, &ldquo;The proof of the pudding is in the eating&rdquo;.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>[CLICK] Open Science will prove its role if it helps to accelerate the discovery, the innovation and the inventions.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>[CLICK] Secondly, Open Science to support in a direct way the complex processes of building high levels of Technology Readiness and Manufacturing Readiness. Such readiness levels are today the ultimate goals to could help the humankind be prepared for solving the Grand Challenges.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>[CLICK] Not last, Open Science to increase the scientific literacy of people and help create a real knowledge society where there is no room for fake news or hysteria; a society in which we are able to make evidence-based decisions for quality, sustainable leaving.&nbsp;</strong></p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>------</strong></p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>Before I open the floor for questions, I would like to mention a series of advocacy events (www.focusopenscience.org) that we are producing in collaboration with UCL Press and LIBER (The European Association of Research Libraries)</strong></p>

    <p><strong>We started in 2015 and this is what we delivered so far. If you want to join this series, please contact me.</strong></p>

  title: 18. Finnish Universities of Applied Sciences – developing open science practices
  description: "<p><strong>The purpose of this presentation is to describe the current
    state of openness in Finnish universities of applied sciences and the ongoing
    work to develop open science policies and practices.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Research,
    development and innovation (RDI) is one of the mandated tasks of universities
    of applied sciences (UAS) in Finland. RDI activities are practice oriented, based
    on needs of working life and focused on problem solving. They typically take place
    in close cooperation with the customers generating new knowledge, competence,
    products and services. Strong focus on regional development also needs to be mentioned.</p>\n\n<p>UASs
    are committed to targets of open science through the project called &rdquo;Enhancing
    openness in the user driven innovation ecosystem of universities&rdquo; (Avoimuuden
    lis&auml;&auml;minen korkeakoulujen k&auml;ytt&auml;j&auml;l&auml;ht&ouml;isess&auml;
    innovaatioekosysteemiss&auml;&rdquo;). The aim of the project is to develop and
    implement such policies and practices which will improve the openness of RDI projects,
    data and publications. It also tries to figure out new ways to disseminate the
    results of the RDI projects.</p>\n\n<p>In order to develop open policy and processes
    it has been necessary to collect information about the current state of the openness.
    This poster will present the results of inquiries carried out in the autumn 2015
    and in the spring 2016.</p>\n\n<p>The poster will give information about the following
    issues concerning the state of the openness in Finnish UASs:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>the
    state of the openness in strategy and policy level</li>\n\t<li>the competence
    of personnel in the strategic and practical implementation of openness (researchers,
    RDI administration, projects, libraries and information management)</li>\n\t<li>the
    type and openness of RDI environments and infrastructures</li>\n\t<li>the openness
    of research data / data produced in projects</li>\n\t<li>the openness of publications</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The
    open access movement in UASs began already in 2007. As a result, the open repository
    Theseus was launched in 2009 and the open access statement was given in the same
    year by Arene, the Rectors&rsquo; Conference of Finnish UAS.</p>\n\n<p>At the
    moment Theseus is the biggest open repository in Finland. It is administered by
    AMKIT Consortium which coordinates cooperation among the UAS libraries. In the
    future Theseus will be developed to serve better as a repository of self-archiving
    and parallel publishing.</p>\n\n<p>UASs have a significant role in the Finnish
    innovation ecosystem. It is extremely important to ensure that the know-how and
    the knowledge is effectively shared and widely accessible. There is a lot of work
    to do and the libraries of UASs are acknowledged partners in that work.</p>\n\n<p>The
    Ministry of Education and Culture of Finland promotes open science through the
    Open Science and Research Initiative (ATT). The objective is for Finland to become
    one of the leading countries in the openness of science and research by the year
    2017.</p>"

  title: 'Universities and Knowledge Sharing: The Curtin Open Knowledge Initaitive'
  description: <p>Universities are key sites of knowledge creation. Governments and
    research funders are increasingly interested in ensuring that their investments
    in the production of new knowledge deliver a quantifiable return on investment,
    including in the form of &lsquo;impact&rsquo;. Ensuring that research outputs
    are not locked behind paywalls, and that research data can be interrogated and
    built upon are increasingly central to efforts to improve the effectiveness of
    global research landscapes. We argue that mandating and promoting open access
    (OA) for published research outputs, as well as the sharing of research data are
    important elements of building a vibrant open knowledge system, but they are not
    enough. Supporting diversity within knowledge-making institutions; enabling collaboration
    across boundaries between universities and wider communities; and addressing inequalities
    in access to knowledge resources and in opportunities to contribute to knowledge
    making processes are also important. New tools are needed to help universities,
    funders, and communities to understand the extent to which a university is operating
    as an effective open knowledge institution; as well as the steps that might be
    taken to improve open knowledge performance. This presentation discusses our team&rsquo;s
    efforts to develop a model of Open Knowledge that is not confined to measures
    of OA and open data. The Curtin Open Knowledge Initiative is a project of the
    Centre for Culture and Technology at Curtin University. With funding from the
    university, we are exploring the extent to which universities are functioning
    as effective open knowledge institutions; as well as the types of information
    that universities, funders, and communities might need to understand an institution&rsquo;s
    open knowledge performance and how it might be improved. The challenges of data
    collection on open knowledge practices at scale, and across national, cultural
    and linguistic boundaries are also discussed.</p>

  title: Presence of Open Science Skills in the Croatian LIS Curriculum
  description: |-
    <p>Open science is an ever-evolving phenomenon. Open science deals with the issue of availability of data and publications, which includes an open approach with which publicly funded research seeks to be made available to all members of society. Open science is an umbrella term that includes a multitude of assumptions about the future of knowledge creation and dissemination (Fecher &amp; Friesike, 2014, p. 17). The field of open science includes open access to publications, open research data, open cooperation, open educational resources, and civic science (Bueno de la Fuente, n.d.). The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) emphasizes libraries as a key player and fundamental driver of open science because they are active in preserving, publishing and disseminating digital scientific material in the form of publications, data and other content related to research. Libraries offer an infrastructure that allows scientists to share and use the results of their work which is crucial for open science (OECD, 2015, p. 12). During their studies, LIS students acquire various knowledge and develop a set of skills that will prepare them for work in today&rsquo;s information environment. In 2020 LIBER&rsquo;s Digital Skills for Library Staff and Researchers Working Group published a visual presentation of the necessary competencies for librarians and researchers. Visualization of Open Science Skills was created by reviewing the literature, going through competency frameworks, and exploring available learning resources which focused on Open Science (McCaffrey et al., 2020). Information science studies, including those in Croatia, are exposed to constant changes in the field, including the development of open science. For this reason, it is necessary to constantly adapt study programmes by adding skills and competences allowing students to acquire basic knowledge related to the promotion and advocacy of open science. The core idea of the term &ldquo;open science&rdquo;, and everything this concept encompasses, should be an integral part of study programs in the field of information sciences. Therefore, this study aims to explore through which courses in information science studies in Croatia students acquire knowledge and skills related to the phenomenon of open science. It will also identify and map all skills and competencies necessary for open science in curricula at the LIS studies in Croatia: Department of Information and Communication Sciences (Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences (FHSS), University of Zagreb), Department of information sciences (Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences (FHSS), Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek) and Department of information science (University of Zadar). Qualitative method that will be used in this research is content analysis. Sample for this research contains all curricula of the LIS studies in Croatia (Zagreb, Osijek and Zadar). All existing skills and competencies from LIS curricula will be extracted and mapped to Open Science Skills in order to determine which of those are incorporated in LIS studies in Croatia and to identify those which are missing. Results will show how much Open Science Skills are represented in the LIS curricula in Croatia and in which directions LIS curricula in Croatia should be developed in order to expand and incorporate knowledge and skills essential to prepare new information experts for their future roles in open science.

  title: Promoting Open Science through new The Bridge of Knowledge platform at Gdansk
    University of Technology
  description: '<p>The process of scholarly communications and adopting Open Science
    principles is changing dramatically. It has matured significantly by using a proper
    infrastructure for sharing and dissemination of scientific knowledge. Nowadays,
    creating awareness among academic community and offer solutions to specific issues
    are the most important goals for the Library. We would like to present challenges
    and strategies to promote scientific output of Gdansk University of Technology
    (GUT), Poland through new established platform &ldquo;MOST Wiedzy&rdquo;. MOST
    Wiedzy in Polish means The Bridge of Knowledge and stands as acronym of Multidisciplinary
    Open System Transferring Knowledge. It should be stressed that this project is
    co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund within the Optional Programme
    Digital Poland for the years 2014 &ndash; 2020. MOST Wiedzy project complements
    other features under the umbrella of Open Science platform. The platform is a
    solution that supports not only scholarly communication but try to facilitate
    the cooperation between university and business industry. The main goals include
    for example: integrating data from different databases and providers as well as
    establishing open repository. MOST Wiedzy is a modern platform that allows to
    present scientific profiles and research conducted at GUT. Through its website,
    users can search for publications, teaching activities or research equipment.
    MOST Wiedzy offers repository support from team of experienced librarians that
    not only upload the open access manuscripts but in addition, steer publications
    through different phases such as editing or promoting. In our poster, we would
    like to demonstrate how MOST Wiedzy project helps researcher to share their scientific
    results, gain recognition and promote their achievements.</p>'

  title: 7.1 The Emerging Role of Institutional CRIS in Facilitating Open Scholarship
  description: |-
    <p>This paper describes the evolution of institutional CRIS (Current Research Information Systems) from their traditional role as a tool managed by the Research Office to manage and assess research towards more widespread uses within institutions, in particular within the Library, to facilitate Open Science.</p>

    <p>Open Science or Scholarship is one of the hottest topics around. Organisations and funders from the G8 down stress the importance of openness in driving everything from global innovation through to more accountable governance; not to mention the more direct possibility that non-compliance could result in grant income drying up for individual researchers.</p>

    <p>We will focus on the UK, using St Andrews as a detailed example, describing the organisational, procedural and technological responses to this &lsquo;open by default&rsquo; agenda, and why and how the Library is taking a leading role in these changes.</p>

    <p>We have had a CRIS since 2006, evolving in tandem with the rapidly changing external policies and slower cultural shifts towards more and more open access to research outputs. The CRIS is a tool for managers but increasingly for researchers too. The latter are key to addressing some of the challenges we face as institutions in developing strategies to support Open Scholarship. The CRIS provides a single portal bringing corporate and academic research activity together, reducing duplicate data entry, increasing data quality, identifying authority sources of information and recording complex relationships between researchers, projects, outputs and impact.</p>

    <p>Increasingly a CRIS is the primary bibliographic record and a similar role is emerging for research data. The Library has a key role to play in curating, preserving and sharing the metadata and digital objects produced as a result of research undertaken at the Institution. Arguably the Library is also key to bridging the gap between the research process itself and its more traditional end of life curation, archiving and preservation role. In particular with research data management the challenge is to understand sufficiently the common and discipline-specific research processes in order to engage with researchers at the appropriate times and with the appropriate skills and advice.</p>

    <p>At St Andrews we are exploring the use of our CRIS to help build these contacts with researchers both with Open Access and Open Data throughout the lifecycle and the paper will report on both the successes achieved and issues encountered.</p>

    <p><strong>Anna Clements</strong>&nbsp;was appointed Assistant Director of Library Services at&nbsp; University of St Andrews, to head up the new Digital Research Division created in April 2015. The Division brings together&nbsp; Open Access &amp; Research Publications Support, Research Data Management, Digital Humanities and Research Computing. There is also a remit to develop Bibliometric and Digital Science support services.</p>

    <p>Anna moved to the Library from IT Services in 2013. In IT Services she held posts as&nbsp; Programme Manager,&nbsp; Data Architect and Enterprise Architect and was also co-opted to serve as Senior Research Policy Advisor in 2011. Prior to joining the University in 2003,&nbsp; Anna had over 20 years experience working as a consultant, software developer and project manager designing and building systems for a variety of SMEs,&nbsp; and UK/ US educational and academic publishers.</p>

    <p>Her current role consolidates her skills and expertise in data management, research information management and policy development.&nbsp; She is a tireless advocate, within the University and (inter)nationally of the basic management information principles of entering data once and using open standards to improve data quality whilst minimizing the data collection burden across the research sector.</p>

  title: Learnings on encouraging open data sharing in science with open source tools
  description: <p>Over the past two years, we have been working with researchers to
    help them better manage their data and promote open science best practices as
    part of our open source project Frictionless Data for Reproducible Research. Along
    the way, we have collaborated with scientists in a variety of ways, from working
    with early career researchers to enact cultural change, to working with established
    researcher groups on large-scale projects. We&rsquo;ve learned which types of
    projects, audiences, and domains are more successful (and more accepting) of open
    data sharing for open science. This talk will discuss the lessons we have learned
    while highlighting some successful use cases to show how data management can positively
    impact open science goals.</p>

  title: The use of controlled, accepted, preferably multi-lingual, vocabularies can
    help achieve open-science outcomes
  description: |-
    <p>Environmental science teams are characteristically multi-disciplinary, multi-national, and multi-organisational. The environmental and ecological challenges that face us make these characteristics&nbsp;unavoidable if the best open science is to be achieved. The importance of ensuring the terms that describe shared data, and indeed information, are well-understood and properly defined cannot be under-estimated, not just within the teams, but also when sharing the results with the world.&nbsp;Fundamental to the achievement of open science is sharing the data on which you base your work for others to use. For this you need to have your data, at the very least, understandable by others.</p>

    <p>Three approaches are proposed to improve the use of controlled,&nbsp;accepted, preferably multi-lingual, vocabularies, and these are discussed in the presentation, to provide exemplars, to encourage&nbsp;early alignment with an intended repository (TRUSTed of course), and to provide educational packages. It is recommended that these are all&nbsp; valuable, while taking care of any confounding factors, such as multi-linguality and researcher&#39;s ability to efficiently discover suitable vocabularies for them to use or contribute to.</p>

  title: Building capacity for Open Science through institutional repository training
  description: |-
    <p>The talk presents a concept of Open Science-related training developed with the aim of facilitating the adoption of institutional repositories in a specific local context (Serbia). This context is marked by a considerable delay in infrastructure development, the lack of institutionalized training on Open Science, a knowledge gap, and insufficient library staff. Although institutionalized training is indispensable in the long-term, this example shows that a combination of bottom-up approaches and highly customized and informal training can increase the Open Science capacity of researchers, librarians and even institutions, which is highly relevant in the context of building competence and capabilities for EOSC. In these terms, it may be instructive for other environments with poor formal training on Open Science.</p>

    <p>The adoption of the Open Science Platform (the national OS policy) in 2018, spurred the development of institutional repositories in Serbia and the leading role in this process has been taken by the University of Belgrade Computer Centre (RCUB). Before the adoption of the OS Platform, training on OS was mainly provided through international projects. The official Library and Information Science curriculum,&nbsp;Librarian Licensure Examination programme, and&nbsp;professional development courses for librarians and training programmes offered by university libraries did not address OS-related skills, due to which there was a knowledge gap in the library and research communities, and this threatened the adoption of the developing infrastructure.</p>

    <p>To overcome this, the University of Belgrade Computer Centre decided to include training (for repository managers and end users), along with software, hosting, and technical support, in the service package offered to institutions. A dedicated user support team responsible for designing and implementing training was established. The training programme covers a range of topics beyond repository features and workflows: Open Access policies, FAIR principles, metadata standards, copyright, self-archiving policies, altmetrics, dissemination through metadata harvesting, discovery platforms (OpenAIRE, BASE, CORE), using institutional repositories in the context of Research Data Management and cultural heritage. Training formats include predefined lectures and webinars, but also highly customized sessions and informal consultations.</p>

    <p>As a result, dozens of repository managers (mainly librarians) and hundreds of end users (researchers) have been trained so far. A number of trained repository managers have already started organizing training on various OS topics at their institutions. Together with the user support team, they form a strong network enabling dynamic information exchange. At the same time, there is a growing interest among researchers for additional training on particular OS topics (RDM, copyright, integration of the repository in various institutional workflows). Also, continuous and flexible support encourages content diversity in repositories. The concept of training developed by the RCUB user support team has so far proven to be efficient in mitigating the lack of institutionalized training. However, in order to provide full support for all aspects of Open Science (esp. RDM and citizen science), it will be necessary to establish institutionalized training.</p>

  title: 'An Open Science Mooc: drawing on the strengths of collaboration between
    institutions'
  description: |-
    <p>How to train on a large scale in open science? By producing a MOOC and drawing on the strengths of collaboration between institutions.</p>

    <p>In 2019, to answer the newly adopted open access policy adopted by Sorbonne University, which aims to give all post-graduate students a training on open science, the Sorbonne University Alliance, an alliance of 6 higher education institutions (France Education International, Insead, National Museum of Natural History, Paris-Boulogne Billancourt Higher Education Centre for the Arts, Sorbonne University and the University of Technology of Compi&egrave;gne) launched the production of a MOOC dedicated to open science.</p>

    <p>Strategic choices were made at the beginning: to produce the MOOC internally, developing the skills of the teams in the process; to include in the team project post-graduate students; and finally to organise several sessions during the year, in order to favour trans-disciplinary community building among the students participating in each session.</p>

    <p>Distributed on the FunMooc platform, in French and English, it is primarily aimed at the community of over 800 PhD students of the Sorbonne University Alliance but it is also open more widely to researchers, research support staff and the general public.</p>

    <p>In this MOOC 5 aspects of open science (publications, data, citizen science, research assessment, society and science) are addressed through the eyes of various scientific and technical information professionals, senior researchers and PhD students from 11 international institutions.</p>

    <p>An entire module focuses on citizen science in order to broaden open science to participation and not just access. As far as we know, this is the first time that citizen science is included in a generalist MOOC on open science in Europe.</p>

    <p>It also strives to build a community of learners, preparing PhD students to more collaborative practices, communicating with the general audience on certain research issues and encouraging researchers to share their different experiments, from all the domains they work on, as humanities, technical sciences and medicine are represented. MOOC sessions are led every semester by trainers from Sorbonne University and the National Museum of Natural History.</p>

    <p>This MOOC carries also to itself the values of open science. The graphic design is based on reusable images. The entire content (texts, interviews in full version and visuals) is under the international and French open licenses and deposited in the Zenodo open archive.</p>

    <p>Our paper will highlight the collaboration of institutions as well as the construction of a community of learners around open science.

  title: Open Science and reproducibility
  description: |-
    <p>SKA is an international project to build the largest and most sensitive radio telescope ever conceived, being the greatest data research public project, once complete. It will be composed of thousands of antennas on Africa and Australia and it will generate a copious data flux (around 1TB/s). A worldwide distributed network of SKA Regional Centres (SRCs) will provide access to the SKA data, to the analysis tools and processing power. The SRCs will be at the core of the exploitation of SKA data, being the place where the science will be done.<br>
    We have long been aware of the need to face the challenge of handling SKA data to extract scientific knowledge, and our compromise is that this is done not only in an efficient way, but following the Scientific Method (hence in a reproducible way). Thus we are particularly engaged in the challenge of ensuring that Big Data science becomes Open Science in the SRCs, becoming the SRCs a reference not only in science and technology but also in Scientific Methodology. IAA-CSIC has started prototyping a SRC that will be fully aligned with the Open Science Principles.<br>
    Astronomy has a long-standing tradition on Open Access through the International Virtual Observatory Alliance (IVOA) but there are new solutions emerging from other fields, involving using e-Science technologies to enhance scientific collaboration, ensuring transparency, opening data collection and methods, or encouraging Open Science.</p>

    in Open Science, under WP2: Developing and Adjusting Guidelines, Policies, and
    Incentives]'
  description: |-
    <p>The primary aim of Work Package 2 (Developing and adjusting guidelines, policies, and incentives) of the BE-OPEN project&nbsp; is to develop national and institutional open science policies that will enable efficient open scientific communication and wide dissemination of publicly funded research outputs. In doing this, project partners and the team implementing WP 2 are to rely on a huge body of documents (primarily recommendations and reports) drafted by the European Commission and national bodies in the European Union (EU) countries, as well as on the knowledge exchange achieved during two study visits conducted as part of the BE-OPEN project: the study visit to the University of Leiden (May 2017) and the study visit to the University of Udine (September 2017). The main purpose of this report is to offer a brief analysis of European Open Access (OA) / Open Science (OS) policies and especially the policies of partner universities, with the aim of identifying optimal solutions for Serbian OA/OS policies at various levels.<br>
    The report briefly describes the main characteristics and elements of European OA/OS policies, the lessons learned during the study visits, and explains the elements of the draft of the Serbian Open Science Platform.</p>

  title: EOSC-Life Publication of generic guidelines for the organization of topic-specific
    Open Calls
  description: |-
    <p>The EOSC-Life project aims to integrate data resources and data processing workflows developed by and in collaboration with the Life Science Research Infrastructures (LS RIs) in the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC). This Work Package, WP3, has the objective to identify scientific user projects that will drive this integration and that will allow the scientific community to shape the building of the EOSC for the life sciences by expressing their needs, and by feeding in their requirements.</p>

    <p>With this document, WP3 presents the guidelines on the preparation, organization and framework of Open Calls for User Projects that will be the main tool for the identification of suitable projects. The Open Calls are designed to contribute to achieving the overarching goal of WP3: to enable EOSC-empowered ground-breaking research, and to generate new knowledge by linking the life science communities to a variety of data resources and a platform of various data analysis tools. By identifying and selecting suitable user projects, WP3 will take a pragmatic approach for populating as well as developing solutions and testing of the EOSC for life sciences. Reusing FAIR data resources and having workflows run in the cloud is becoming increasingly important for researchers, however, building and spreading of cloud technology related skills is still needed for many researchers. WP3 will address those scientists via Open Calls by offering applicants training and consultation with experts across the EOSC-Life consortium. By providing funding, WP3 will also empower scientific groups that have built the capacity and skill sets to run their projects mostly independently or in collaboration. Importantly, selected projects are expected to have a lasting impact and to leave behind some legacy, so that future projects can benefit from their work and re-use their data, tools or workflows. Projects should present novelty in terms of the interplay between RIs and the EOSC, and address important challenges and needs of the life science community.</p>

  title: Final Technical Report (Feb. 2018) - OCSDNet Catalyzing Open and Collaborative
    Science to Address Development Challenges
  description: |-
    <p>The Open and Collaborative Science in Development Network (OCSDNet) is an international<br>
    research network, launched in 2014, to address the fundamental question of whether and how<br>
    open science has the potential to contribute to the achievement of development goals and<br>
    opportunities. Facilitated by a coordination team from the University of Toronto and iHub Kenya,<br>
    the network has been composed of twelve international research teams located throughout<br>
    Latin America, Africa, the Middle East and Asia from highly diverse disciplinary backgrounds.<br>
    Over the course of two years, each team explored the challenges and opportunities for an open<br>
    and collaborative science, and the potential of open science to facilitate fair and sustainable<br>
    development.<br>
    In this final progress report, the coordination team synthesizes insights and lessons learned<br>
    following an analysis of the 12 sub-projects. Over the course of two years, network members<br>
    have recognised that an inclusive open science involves a highly dynamic process of<br>
    negotiating and challenging power relations within highly situated social contexts, and amongst<br>
    actors and institutions with varying claims for knowledge legitimacy. This questioning of power<br>
    within OCSDNet&rsquo;s practice and conceptualization of open science has been in contrast to more<br>
    mainstream discourses, which tend to present Open Science as a neutral set of standards,<br>
    tools, and workflows to be followed, often with the objective of pursuing utilitarian or<br>
    market-driven outcomes. In this report, we reflect briefly on some of these insights and shifting<br>
    discourses and practices of Open Science. The report also includes the more tangible outcomes<br>
    and outputs of the network. We conclude with key recommendations for those who are<br>
    interested in working on topics related to Open Science and development as well as<br>
    suggestions for those facilitating global, heterogeneous research groups in a network structure<br>
    similar to that employed by OCSDNet.</p>

  title: 'Open Science for Better FAIRness: A biodiversity virtual research environment
    point of view'
  description: <p>"FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles"
    (Wilkinson et al. 2016) and "open science" are two complementary movements in
    biodiversity science. Although we need to transition to making scientific data
    and associated material more FAIR, this does not necessarily imply open data or
    open source algorithms. Here, based on the experience of the French Biodiversity
    Data Hub ("Pôle national de données de Biodiversité" - PNDB), which is an e-infrastructure
    for and by researchers, we want to showcase how focusing on openness can be a strategy
    to efficiently reach greater FAIRness. Following DataOne guidance, we can build
    a complete data/metadata ecosystem allowing us to structure heterogeneous environmental
    information systems. Using the Galaxy analysis platform and its related initiatives
    (Galaxy training network, European Erasmus+ Gallantries project, bioconda, bioContainer),
    we can thus illustrate how we can create transparent, peer-reviewed and accessible
    tools and workflows and collaborative training material. The Galaxy platform also
    facilitates use of high performance computing infrastructure through notably the
    European Open Science Cloud marketplace. Finally, through our experiences contributing
    to open source projects like EML (Ecological Metadata Language (Michener et al.
    1997)) Assembly Line, EDI (Environmental Data Initiative, or PAMPA (Indicators
    of Marine <em>Protected Areas</em> performance for managing coastal ecosystems,
    resources and their uses), a French platform to help protected areas managers
    to standardize and analyse their data, we also show how building open source "doors"
    through the R Shiny programming language to these environments can be beneficial
    for all.</p>

  title: Open Research Calendar
  description: <p>In a world affected by the COVID-19 crisis where online workshops,
    seminars, and conferences are increasingly hosted online and can be attended with
    the click of a button, keeping track of events is becoming more difficult. A community-powered
    shared calendar, the Open Research Calendar <a href="https://openresearchcalendar.github.io/">(</a><a
    href="https://openresearchcalendar.github.io/">https://openresearchcalendar.github.io</a><a
    href="https://openresearchcalendar.github.io/">)</a>, can enable interested users
    to keep track of open research events. This calendar can help researchers find
    workshops, conferences and seminars on open research without an effortful search,
    and minimise the need for scattered manual updates via community-powered automated
    communication. The Open Research Calendar can also provide event organisers with
    an easy solution to promote their event, reaching a larger audience through this
    central advertisement portal than they could using traditional channels of event
    promotion such as newsletters, blogs and websites. The Open Research Calendar
    addresses these issues through a community Google calendar, which can be synced
    into a person&rsquo;s own personal calendar and is automatically updated as new
    events are added. Events can be added by anyone through entering the key information
    into a short Google form. This information generates an automated Tweet to notify
    followers of the calendar about the new event. Quality control is ensured by the
    community (through a reporting form) and the Open Research Calendar team. The
    hundreds of followers of the Open Research Calendar on Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/OpenResearchCal">@openresearchcal</a><a
    href="https://twitter.com/OpenResearchCal">)</a> indicate that there is a real
    need for this tool. The current aims of the project are to increase awareness
    and encourage submission of events. The code and documentation for the calendar
    is open source and shared with a GNU 3.0 licence to ensure interoperability and
    reuse, so we invite groups to recreate the automation and communication features
    for their own communities. We welcome contributions to the technical development
    of the calendar via our public GitHub repository <a href="https://github.com/openresearchcalendar/">(</a><a

    <p>The H2020 Work Programme is a milestone for the transition to Science 2.0: the era of&nbsp; Open Science (OS) will increase the drive towards collaboration through knowledge sharing across the European Research Area.</p>

    <p>In particular, the Open Data (OD) policy aims at making digital assets, i.e. data, tools and workflows FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable) [1]: available to everyone in Europe.</p>

    <p>FAIR assets allow to reuse data in multiple applications which multiplies the data value thus optimizing the impact of projects funded by public money.&nbsp; NO PANIC: to respect Industry foregrounds Research data must be as open as possible and as closed s necessary!</p>

    <p>The wind energy community generally agrees that sharing assets would shorten the time from new ideas to innovation, making the work more efficient; BUT assets provide a competitive advantage, leading to a reluctance to sharing important data.&nbsp; WHAT TO DO THEN?</p>

  title: An open science approach for evaluating the Vegetation Optimality Model along
    the North-Australian Tropical Transect
  description: |-
    <p><strong>An open science approach for evaluating the Vegetation Optimality Model along the North-Australian Tropical Transect</strong></p>

    <p>Different state-of-the-art land surface models produce a large variety in model outcomes (Whitley et al., 2016), despite their extensive use of local observations such as rooting depths and leaf area index dynamics. Our understanding of differences between models and their underlying assumptions is greatly hampered by our inability to reproduce results generated by different scientists, as model setup routines and exact simulation conditions are not documented in a complete and homogenous fashion.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Here we present an open science approach to reproducible modelling, using the Vegetation Optimality Model (VOM; Schymanski et al., 2009) as an example. The VOM optimizes vegetation properties and dynamics to maximise its Net Carbon Profit, i.e. the difference in total carbon taken up by photosysthesis minus the carbon costs. In this way, vegetation properties are not prescribed, but optimized for maximizing the Net Carbon Profit. The model was applied over six study sites along the North-Australian Tropical Transect.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Open Science is facilitated by the command line tool Renku (renkulab.io), developed by the Swiss Data Science Center and based on existing technologies such as gitlab. Renku tracks all scientific steps from input data processing to the generation of the final figures in order to generate a tree containing the entire workflow, i.e. a knowledge graph. Renku enables easy reproduction of results including all preparatory steps and can be used to easily repeat given steps on updated or new data sets.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Previously, it was already suggested to document the scientific process in more qualitative protocols (Ceola et al., 2015), and to make more more code openly available and formalize workflows (Hutton et al., 2016). With Renku, we take it one step further, also in line with Hut et al., (2017), and document the entire scientific process automatically by using data science, assuring openness, reproducibility and repeatability at the same time.</p>

  title: 'Engaging with Open Science as feminist Early Career Researchers: 6 Top Tips'
  description: |-
    <p>Open Science has much to offer Early-Career Researchers (ECRs) at the start of their research career. For example, Open Science allows ECRs to be credited appropriately for their work, provides opportunity for the wide dissemination of research outputs, and highly values collaboration and collegiality. Indeed, ECRs have contributed substantially to the development and promotion of Open Science, championing initiatives such as journal clubs, how-to guides, and online communities. However, despite the vast contribution of ECRs to this conversation, there has been a notable lack of consideration for how the goals and tools of Open Science align with early career research that stems from a distinctly feminist perspective. In this poster, we discuss the unique position that feminist ECRs occupy in the context of Open Science and provide six evidence-based tips for feminist ECRs who wish to engage with the Open Science conversation. This poster reflects a collaboration between ten feminist ECRs who represent diverse areas of research, backgrounds, and methodologies. Thus, these six tips are a result of both evidence from psychology and metascience, as well as a result of personal reflections on our journeys into and through Open Science spaces.</p>

    <p>Our six tips are: &lsquo;Start at your own pace&rsquo;, &lsquo;Do what you need to survive&rsquo;, &lsquo;Engage in research advocacy&rsquo;, &lsquo;Be as open as possible&rsquo;, &lsquo;Find (or create) your community&rsquo; and</p>

    <p>&lsquo;Consider alternative and diverse mentorship&rsquo;. These tips reflect upon our experiences of navigating Open Science and are designed to provide concrete action-based recommendations for feminist ECRs as they include the principles of Open Science into their scholarly practice.</p>

    <p>Thus, the practice benefits of this poster are vast.&nbsp;</p>

  title: 'Considerations for Open Practices in Quantum Technologies Research: A reflection
    on current research practices and aims for the future'
  description: |-
    <p>The field of quantum technologies is a fast-paced research environment where new developments are constantly being reported. However, recent controversies -- such as the retraction of a 2018 Nature article claiming to find evidence of the elusive Majorana fermion -- have made me reflect on the research practices of my field and my own practice. When conducting future research, I plan to engage in a variety of open research practices to ensure the reproducibility and transparency of my work, thereby encouraging others in my field to engage with my data, build on it and critically engage with my conclusions.</p>

    <p>Regarding my current research, which is due to be published soon, I aim to implement several practices to ensure my data is freely accessible and to facilitate reproducibility and scrutiny of my studies. This will be achieved by publishing under an open licence as well as depositing datasets and code on an open repository such as Zenodo. In future studies, I would like to explore producing a Registered Report alongside publishing an open online lab notebook through my own personal website. This will improve the transparency of my research throughout the entire process, not just at the time of publication.</p>

    <p>Additionally, I aim to engage with the open datasets of others in my field to help foster a culture of shared datasets that different groups will analyse in different ways, extracting more information from results as well as improving the reliability of our knowledge through collaboration. To assess the efficacy of these ideas for open research practices in the field of quantum technologies, I would benefit from reflections on how successful such practices are in other areas, particularly that of analysing the open data of others within the context of my own research topic.</p>

  title: TRIPLE Training activities on Open Science and the EOSC
  description: |-
    <p>TRIPLE is a H2020 project with a primary aim of developing a discovery platform for SSH. Within the project, the need for increased exchanges and a common understanding of recent European Open Science advancements called for a specific task dedicated to training on Open Science and the EOSC. However, while the training sessions were initially designed to fit the Consortium members&rsquo; needs, we chose to open them to the community and to focus on topics relating both to TRIPLE activities (i.e. the EOSC onboarding) and to services and solutions which are relevant to the whole community (i.e. Open Research Europe, and the EOSC state-of-the-art and objectives).&nbsp;</p>

    <p>The presentation will focus on activities performed within this task and in particular on the organisation of training sessions in the form of webinars, the production of guidelines and training material and the close collaboration with research institutions and training communities. We will introduce the implemented synergies with the main Research Infrastructures&nbsp;in the SSH field (OPERAS, CLARIN, CESSDA, DARIAH) and with training coordinators communities (EOSC Skills and Training Working Group, <a href="https://www.openaire.eu/cop-training">OpenAIRE CoP of Training coordinators</a>, SSHOC Training community, <a href="https://www.icdi.it/it/attivita/tf-cc">ICDI Competence Center</a>). We will also present the strategies adopted to provide support to TRIPLE members on Open Science and the EOSC via adequate training, to engage new potential interested audiences in TRIPLE&rsquo;s events and to produce FAIR training materials whose reusability by the general public will be ensured.&nbsp;</p>

  title: Introducing Linked Open Data Living Informational Books
  description: <p>In a recent article, Claire Clivaz surveys the rise of VREs (Virtual
    Research Environments) that allow for scientific hypothesis-driven, iterative,
    and collaborative research in the Humanities. In this presentation, we propose
    a new kind of VRE, the Linked Open Data Living Informational Book or LODLIB, essentially
    a scientific hypothesis-driven iterative digital codex. LODLIBs follow the structure
    of scientific articles (introduction, materials and methods, results, discussion),
    leverage international Linked Open Data standards (unique and interconnected DOIs),
    rely on non-commercial Open Science repositories, include internal data dictionaries
    and lexicographical resources, embed datasets and code within the digital book,
    invite global open peer-review and collaboration, and allow for cycles of continuous
    improvement characteristic of software and systems development. Essentially, the
    LODLIB reimagines the codex as human- and machine-readable software, bringing
    together research and publishing, the Sciences and the Humanities. The LODLIB
    format inverts the power- and economic relationships between academic authors
    and publishers, opens up academic discourse up to the global public, allows for
    rich analytics about readership and citations, and has the potential to make monographs
    and compilations go viral in online environments. The conclusion will relate the
    story of the presenter&rsquo;s prototyping of the LODLIB genre in to propose and
    realize a new, scientific solution to Q and the Synoptic Problem.</p>

  title: Fostering Open Science by using Blockchain Technology
  description: "<p>Sectors like finance, science, production, licensing, and education
    are gaining more and more interest in blockchain technologies (BT) and start to
    develop BT-based applications to benefit from the unique characteristics of this
    technology. BT promises benefits in trust, collaboration, organization, identification,
    credibility, and transparency.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In our research, we focus on the
    application of BT in science, in particular, open science. The idea behind open
    science is to make scientific research more transparent and accessible to mitigate
    problems. Examples are intransparent review processes, plagiarism, restricted
    freedom of research, and paywalls restricting access to scientific publications.
    &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In a first step, we analyzed existing BT-based applications related
    to open science according to the following criterions:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Does
    the application build on a custom or existing blockchain (like, e.g., Bitcoin)?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Which
    consensus method is used? Proof of work, proof of stake, or other.&nbsp;</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Which
    are the target phases within the research cycle? We divided the phases into evaluation/idea,
    experiment, documentation, processing, analysing, publication, and reputation.&nbsp;</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>How
    well is the application documented?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>What
    is the maturity level of the application? Concept, prototype, or deployed.&nbsp;</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In
    total, we investigated 43 applications which we identified primarily by search
    engines (e.g., Google Scholar) and divided them into the categories reproducibility
    (9), trustability (12), decentralized storage/database (7), marketplace (4), identity
    management (3), privacy/confidentiality (2), and infrastructure providers (6).
    Regarding maturity level, the vast majority of applications is in the concept
    phase. Some prototypical systems are available, but there are only a few deployed
    and well-established applications (e.g., OriginStamp, Hyperledger, and Bernstein).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Our
    analysis showed that existing projects and applications do not yet make use of
    the full potential of BT. Thus, our research goal is to develop ideas for further
    applications. We imagine, for example, using BT to store study designs and hypotheses
    tamper-proof, as well as all survey results. Storing this information in a blockchain
    ensures that the results can be compared to the hypothesis verifiably. Another
    idea targets the Internet of Things where, e.g., measurement data of sensors could
    be stored in a blockchain ensuring that the data cannot be manipulated later on.
    This would increase the credibility of experiments that are too complex to be
    reproducible by a third party.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Finally, we point out challenges
    that need to be addressed in the future to make sure the scientific community
    can benefit from BT. One of the challenges we identified is the design and development
    of correct and secure smart contracts. Such contracts often manage valuable resources
    (information or money in the form of cryptocurrencies) which could get inaccessible
    (even for the owner) or stolen if functional correctness and security are not
    given. Thus, we forecast that approaches for the evaluation and formal verification
    of smart contracts will become crucial in the future. Finally, in our view, researchers
    and the blockchain community should address topics like standardization and frameworks
    to facilitate access and use of BT and therefore, to increase its rate of adoption
    in the scientific community and beyond. Overall, we analyzed current blockchain
    applications and projects for science to create a state-of-the-art view, described
    our ideas for the future to foster science and identified challenges that need
    to be addressed to use the full potential of the BT.</p>"

  title: 'Open Science and Open Data: Definitive Steps Institutions and Researchers
    Can Take to Make Research Output More Discoverable, Accessible, and Transparent'
  description: |-
    <p>Presented at&nbsp;JpGU, Session M-GI31</p>

    <p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>

    <p>Research is a critical element to addressing emerging global issues. At AGU our new Strategic Plan includes a goal to move our science from &quot;usable&quot; to &quot;used&quot;. We see this as positioning our science outcomes to be more discoverable by those who need them, accessible to decision makers both globally and locally, and transparent such that it is clear how the research was conducted with all the relevant data, software, workflows, and methods available for evaluation. Global issues require our researchers to have access to all possible information, broader collaborations, and more community involvement by those impacted. Science that is &quot;used&quot; helps to solve problems both in our community and across the globe. This talk will recommend actions our institutions can take to support and encourage researchers to be more open.&nbsp;</p>

  title: ESFRI Science Clusters Position Statement on Expectations and Long-Term Commitment
    in Open Science
  description: "<p>THE SCIENCE CLUSTERS&nbsp;are EU collaborative projects that were
    launched in 2019 to link ESFRI and other world-class Research Infrastructures
    (RIs) to the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC).</p>\n\n<p>The main impacts of
    the Science Clusters&rsquo; work programme concern:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>the improved
    access of researchers to data, tools and resources, leading to new insights and
    innovation for data-driven science both within and beyond the context of the domains
    in which the clusters are rooted;</li>\n\t<li>the creation of a cross-border open
    innovation environment for FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable)
    data management for economies of scale, to develop synergies and rise the efficiency
    and productivity of researchers through open-science standards and thematic services;</li>\n\t<li>the
    enhanced co-developments to foster the cross-domain interoperability central to
    the EOSC goal.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The Science Clusters are an integral part of
    EOSC. Their services and outcomes are now forming the core of the emerging EOSC
    fabric. As important partners of EOSC, Science Clusters contribute to its development
    and its implementation process. Importantly, the Science Clusters form a natural
    collaboration between the ESFRI RIs&rsquo; management boards partners in the clusters.</p>\n\n<p>As
    EOSC matures and begins delivering data and services for European research, a
    discussion is needed to stimulate the Open Science practices, cross-domain interoperability
    and long-term coordination of the scientific communities covered by the five Science
    Clusters.</p>\n\n<p><strong>This position paper contributes formally to explain
    the urgent need of EC to support a longer-term role of the five Science Clusters
    to provide content to the EOSC, to enhance researchers&rsquo; involvement in Open
    Science and to suggest potential cooperative pathways in the Horizon-Europe framework
    and along with the EOSC Association roadmap.</strong></p>\n\n<p>This paper is
    aimed at highlighting:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Expectations of the clusters and the
    concerned research communities, pointing out a common structured vision and a
    series of suggestions for the future.</li>\n\t<li>A more detailed analysis from
    each cluster, that is provided for completeness.</li>\n</ul>"

  title: FAIR Research Objects for realizing Open Science with RELIANCE EOSC project
  description: '<p>The H2020 <u>Reliance</u> project delivers a suite of innovative
    and interconnected services that extend European Open Science Cloud (EOSC)''s
    capabilities to support the management of the research lifecycle within Earth
    Science Communities and Copernicus Users. The project has delivered 3 complementary 
    technologies: Research Objects (ROs), Data Cubes and AI-based Text Mining.</p><p><u>RoHub</u>
    is a Research Object management platform that implements these 3 technologies
    and enables researchers to collaboratively manage, share and preserve their research
    work.</p><p>RoHub implements the full RO model and paradigm: resources associated
    to a particular research work are aggregated into a single FAIR digital object,
    and metadata relevant for understanding and interpreting the content is represented
    as semantic metadata that are user and machine readable. </p><p>The development
    of RoHub is co-designed and validated through multidisciplinary and thematic real
    life use cases led by three different Earth Science communities: Geohazards, Sea
    Monitoring and Climate Change communities. </p><p>A RO commonly starts its life
    as an empty Live RO. ROs aggregate new objects through their whole lifecycle.
    This means, a RO is filled incrementally by aggregating new relevant resources
    such as workflows, datasets, documents according to its typology that are being
    created, reused or repurposed. These resources can be modified at any point in
    time.</p><p>We can copy and keep ROs in time through snapshots which reflect their
    status at a given point in time. Snapshots can have their own identifiers (DOIs)
    which facilitates tracking the evolution of a research. At some point in time,
    a RO can be published and archived (so called Archived RO) with a permanent identifier
    (DOI). New Live ROs can be derived based on an existing Archived RO, for instance
    by forking it. </p><p>To guide researchers, different types of Research Objects
    can be created:</p><ul><p>Bibliography-centric: includes manuals, anonymous interviews,
    publications, multimedia (video, songs) and/or other material that support research;</p><p>Data-centric:
    refers to datasets which can be indexed, discovered and manipulated;</p><p>Executable:
    includes the code, data and computational environment along with a description
    of the research object and in some cases a workflow. This type of ROs can be executed
    and is often used for scripts and/or Jupyter Notebooks;</p><p>Software-centric:
    also known as "Code as a Research Object". Software-centric ROs include source
    codes and associated documentation. They often include sample datasets for running
    tests.</p><p>Workflow-centric: contains workflow specifications, provenance logs
    generated when executing the workflows, information about the evolution of the
    workflow (version) and its components elements, and additional annotations for
    the workflow as a whole.</p><p>Basic: can contain anything and is used when the
    other types do not cover the need.</p></ul><p>To ease the understanding and the
    reuse of the ROs, each type of RO (except Basic RO) has a template folder structure
    that we recommend researchers to select. For instance an executable RO has 4 folders:</p><ul><p><em>''biblio''</em> where 
    researchers can aggregate documentations, scientific papers that øed to the development
    of the software/tool that is aggregated in the tool folder;</p><p><em>''input''</em> where
    all the input datasets required for executing the RO are aggregated;</p><p><em>''output''</em> where
    some or all the results generated by executing the RO are aggregated;</p><p><em>''tool''</em> where
    the executable tool is aggregated. Typically, we aggregate Jupyter Notebook and/or
    executable workflows (Galaxy or snakemake workflows).</p></ul><p>In addition to
    the different types of ROs and associated template structures, researchers can
    select the type of resources that constitutes the main entity of a RO: for instance,
    a Jupyter Notebook can be selected as the main entity of an executable RO. As
    shown on Fig. 1, this additional metadata is then visible to everyone (and machine
    readable) to ease reuse. Examples of Bibliography-centric and Data-centric Research
    Objects are shown on Fig. 2: the overall overview of any types of Research Object
    is always the same with mandatory metadata information such as the title, description,
    authors &amp; collaborators, sketch (featured plots/images), the content of the
    RO (with different structures depending on the type of ROs). Additional information
    is displayed on the right panel such as number of downloads, additional discovered
    metadata (automatically discovered from the Reliance text enrichment service),
    free keywords (added by end-users) and citation. The ''<em>toolbox</em>'' and
    ''<em>share</em>'' sections allows end-users to download, snapshot and archive
    the RO and/or share it.</p><p>Any Research Object in RoHub is a FAIR digital object
    that is for instance findable in OpenAire, including Live ROs.</p><p>In our presentation,
    we will showcase different types of ROs for the 3 Earth Science communities represented
    in Reliance to highlight how the scientists in our respective disciplines changed
    their working methodology towards Open Science.</p>'

  title: 'Collective Knowledge (CK): an open-source framework to automate, reproduce,
    and crowdsource HPC experiments'
  description: |-
    <p>Validating experimental results from articles has finally become a norm at many HPC and systems conferences. Nowadays, more than half of accepted papers pass artifact evaluation and share related code and data. Unfortunately, lack of a common experimental framework, common research methodology and common formats places an increasing burden on evaluators to validate a growing number of ad-hoc artifacts. Furthermore, having too many ad-hoc artifacts and Docker snapshots is almost as bad as not having any (!), since they cannot be easily reused, customized and built upon.</p>

    <p>While overviewing more than 100 papers during artifact evaluation at HPC conferences, we noticed that many of them use similar experimental setups, benchmarks, models, data sets, environments and platforms. This motivated us to develop Collective Knowledge (CK), an open workflow framework with a unified Python API to automate common researchers&rsquo; tasks such as detecting software and hardware dependencies, installing missing packages, downloading data sets and models, compiling and running programs, performing autotuning and co-design, crowdsourcing time-consuming experiments across computing resources provided by volunteers similar to SETI@home, reproducing results, automatically generating interactive articles, and so on: http://cKnowledge.org .</p>

    <p>In this talk I will introduce CK concepts and present several real world use cases from the Raspberry Pi foundation, ACM, General Motors, Amazon and Arm on collaborative benchmarking, autotuning and co-design of efficient software/hardware stacks for emerging workloads including deep learning. I will also present our latest initiative to create an open repository of reusable research components and workflows at HPC conferences. We plan to use it to automate the Student Cluster Competition Reproducibility Challenge at the Supercomputing conference.</p>

  title: Plan P - A Publishers' Offer to Institutions and Funders to Transform to
    Open Science
  description: |-
    <p>Plan P (<a href="http://planp.science">http://planp.science</a>) is JMIR Publication&rsquo;s collaborative proposal for truly open scholarly communications and a framework for academic institutions and funders to facilitate a transformation towards Open Science. Plan P supports a &ldquo;preprint first&rdquo; publication model (PRC: Preprint - Review - Curate) by creating a platform for rapid AI-supported peer-review of preprints, editorial prospecting of preprints, and publication of curated peer-reviewed preprints in the overlay journal series JMIRx or - via a &ldquo;manuscript marketplace&rdquo; - in any other journal. Hashtag communities are peer-review communities, which include traditional journals but can also be other communities around a certain topical interest, can be targeted by preprint authors by using hashtags in their abstract and are being credited in published preprints. Plan P is also a business model that distributes the costs for peer-review and publication between institutions and funders. Encouragement of Registered Reports is another aspect of Plan P. Finally, Plan P creates research assessment metrics for institutions that go beyond citation-based approaches, measuring adherence to open science best practices. The ultimate goal of this endeavor is to develop the easiest path for authors to create transparent work by cataloging their entire research effort - from methodology to preliminary results and on to publication - as well as creating an environment for librarians where the needs of their budgets and institution do not conflict with their Open Science goals.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Join Dr Gunther Eysenbach, founder and CEO of JMIR, as he presents this exciting plan to accelerate the move to Open Science. We would be thrilled to present to the FORCE2021 audience, given their interest in disruptive technologies and appreciation of the need for more open and equitable publishing solutions.</p>

  title: Open Science and Codes of Conduct on Research Integrity
  description: |-
    <p>Abstract</p>

    <p>The purpose of this article is to examine the conceptual alignment between the ethical principles of research integrity and open science. Research integrity is represented in this study by four general codes of conduct on responsible conduct of research (RCR), three of them international in scope, and one national. A representative list of ethical principles associated with open science is compiled in order to create categories for assessing the content of the codes. According to the analysis, the current understanding of RCR is too focused on traditional publications and the so called FFP definition of research misconduct to fully support open science. The main gaps include recognising citizen science and societal outreach and supporting open collaboration both among the research community and beyond its traditional borders. Updates for both the content of CoCs as well as the processes of creating such guidelines are suggested.</p>

  title: 'BLAZE: The Comprehensive Open Science Discovery Tool'
  description: |-
    <p>Discovery is an essential task for every researcher, especially in dynamic research fields such as biomedicine. For example, researchers often need to get an overview of a research field (e.g. at the beginning of their PhD, or later on when venturing in a neighbouring field) or a certain topic (e.g. when writing the state-of-the-art for a project proposal).</p>

    <p>Currently, there are only a limited number of discovery tools for scientific content that can be used by a mainstream audience. Most researchers still rely on scholarly search engines, which satisfy some information needs, but are a poor discovery tool. Search engines present resources in a linear, one-dimensional way, making it necessary to sift through every item in the list. They provide little context apart from basic metadata, which makes it hard to infer the topical structure of the content. Most scholarly search engines are also not suited to the new open science paradigm, in which not only the written results are published, but also data, source code, images etc., because they typically ignore non-publication resources like GenBank and other NCBI databases.</p>

    <p>Another problem is that the results of the discovery process are usually not shared; they become visible only later as references in a publication or reading lists, but again with very little context and structure. Therefore, the discovery process is repeated over and over again by different researchers, because it lacks the collaborative efficiencies that have become the norm in the open science environment and researchers&#39; time and resources are wasted.</p>

    <p>To overcome these problems with the traditional, closed discovery process, we propose BLAZE, the collaborative discovery tool for open science.</p>

  title: 'Open Life Science: Empowering early career researchers to become open science
    leaders'
  description: |-
    <p><strong>Motivation:</strong> As scientists, we are provided training and guidance in how to conduct research in the lab, design algorithms, analyse data and publish them. However, scientists are rarely expected to apply important skills such as open science principles for tooling and road mapping their projects, planning reproducible workflows, involving others in their work, and leading an inclusive community. Modern bioinformatics communities stand in the interface of computational and biological research. This interdisciplinary position requires us to develop collaborative projects by implementing such &ldquo;open by design&rdquo; principles in our research projects systematically -- skills that aren&rsquo;t necessarily taught at university or graduate school level.&nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>About the project: </strong>Open Life Science (OLS) is a volunteer-driven training and mentoring program aimed at empowering early career researchers and potential academic leaders to become open science ambassadors. Participants join OLS with a proposal to work on an open science project and attend a series of one-on-one mentoring calls over 16 weeks, alternating with full cohort calls that provide training on specific open science and leadership skills. OLS&rsquo;s work is underpinned by a community of over 50 <a href="https://openlifesci.org/about#experts">mentors and expert guest speakers</a>.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Cohort calls cover a broad spectrum of topics relevant to leading an open project, ranging from open science topics, community building, project and contribution management of GitHub repositories, and caring both for yourself and others in your community. Calls are designed to be interactive and engaging, utilising a mix of Zoom&rsquo;s break-out room features to facilitate group discussion, collaborative document editing, and guest speakers from academia and industry giving short talks. The program is modelled on the exact principles we teach, and hence, all materials, including syllabus, call notes, and slides, are shared under the CC-BY licence. Cohort calls are recorded and shared openly on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/OpenLifeSci">YouTube</a>. Third-party organisations and individuals are encouraged to fork, remix and re-use materials.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>Overview of the first round: </strong><a href="https://openlifesci.org/ols-1/projects-participants/">OLS&rsquo;s first cohort (OLS-1)</a>, known as &ldquo;Open Seeds&rdquo;, was conducted from January 2020 until May 2020 with 29 project leaders working on 20 projects. Project leaders came from around the world, including the Netherlands, Spain, Norway, Japan, India, Nepal, Thailand, Kenya, Brazil, Russia, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States. At the end of the program, the project leaders graduate by presenting their work, share their mentorship experience and discuss their future plans on publicly live-streamed video calls.</p>

    <p>In this talk, we will report important observations and outcomes from running the first cohort of our mentoring and training program. At the time of writing, OLS-1 is in final stages of wrap-up and graduation, and we aim to open applications for OLS-2 in May 2020. We will also welcome new mentors and experts, including the project leaders from OLS-1, who will be encouraged to return to join the mentor and expert teams for OLS-2.</p>

  title: Building a Culture of Collaboration in Open Source Communities with The Turing
    Way
  description: |-
    <p><em>The Turing Way (</em>https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/welcome) is a community-driven open source book project that involves and supports a diverse research community in ensuring that reproducible, collaborative, ethical and inclusive data research is &quot;too easy not to do&quot;. Using this project as a model, I will discuss the importance of collaborative development, documentation and sharing best practices that can be adopted by various stakeholders to make their research more reproducible and effective.</p>

    <p>Built upon a culture of collaboration,<em> The Turing Way</em> is designed to be welcoming, inclusive and accessible to its members from diverse backgrounds and expertise. It is an open source project, that facilitates all contributions, questions, comments, and discussions via an online repository: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way. Since last year, more than 200 researchers have contributed to this project. They have co-authored chapters and developed resources that have been used by the scientific communities worldwide in learning and promoting reproducible methods in different computational research communities.</p>

    <p>The project has grown from a small team of 10 researchers to a community of collaborators from around the world. The scope of <em>The Turing Way</em> book has also expanded to include the different aspects of reproducibility, project design, collaboration, communication, and ethics in data research. We continue to support our members in learning new skills and facilitate their interaction with the project via online co-working spaces and mentored-contributions.</p>

    <p>We believe that projects like <em>The Turing Way</em>, that promote a culture of collaboration, can have a significant impact on improving access to information and the equitable decision-making process by our peers and future generations. We further invite FOSS participants to make use of <em>The Turing Way</em> and participate in its community by contributing and enhancing its resources with their perspectives.</p>

    <p>Plan P - A Publishers&rsquo; Offer to Institutions and Funders to Transform to Open Science</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Plan P (<a href="http://planp.science">http://planp.science</a>) is JMIR Publication&rsquo;s collaborative proposal for truly open scholarly communications and a framework for academic institutions and funders to facilitate a transformation towards Open Science. Plan P supports a &ldquo;preprint first&rdquo; publication model (PRC: Preprint - Review - Curate) by creating a platform for rapid AI-supported peer-review of preprints, editorial prospecting of preprints, and publication of curated peer-reviewed preprints in the overlay journal series JMIRx or - via a &ldquo;manuscript marketplace&rdquo; - in any other journal. Hashtag communities are peer-review communities, which include traditional journals but can also be other communities around a certain topical interest, can be targeted by preprint authors by using hashtags in their abstract and are being credited in published preprints. Plan P is also a business model that distributes the costs for peer-review and publication between institutions and funders. Encouragement of Registered Reports is another aspect of Plan P. Finally, Plan P creates research assessment metrics for institutions that go beyond citation-based approaches, measuring adherence to open science best practices. The ultimate goal of this endeavor is to develop the easiest path for authors to create transparent work by cataloging their entire research effort - from methodology to preliminary results and on to publication - as well as creating an environment for librarians where the needs of their budgets and institution do not conflict with their Open Science goals.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Join Dr Gunther Eysenbach, founder and CEO of JMIR, as he presents this exciting plan to accelerate the move to Open Science. We would be thrilled to present to the FORCE2021 audience, given their interest in disruptive technologies and appreciation of the need for more open and equitable publishing solutions.</p>

  title: 'Open Science: Where do we go from here?'
  description: "<p>When looking at the calendar of events under the 2018 Austrian
    presidency of the European Union, we get the impression Open Science is dominating
    the STI agenda and research policy discussions. However, when we look around us
    here in Austria (and in many other European countries), we see a lot of wonderful
    initiatives and bottom-up activities, there is commitment of policy makers and
    research funding and performing organisations, but the topic of Open Science is
    still highly distributed across institutions without a national strategy let alone
    a coherent legislation. Whereas there is a strong push from the EU to foster a
    multi-dimensional transition to Open Science, there is no common baseline for
    how to implement Open Science nationally.</p>\n\n<p>In my talk I will report on
    the outcomes of mutual learning exercise (MLE) that was set up by the Commission
    and 13 countries to address this. In this Open Science MLE we embraced a hands-on,
    &lsquo;learning by doing&rsquo; approach supported by external expertise. Concrete
    examples, models, best practices and knowledge exchanges fostered broader understanding
    of the implications and benefits of Open Science strategies, covering key elements
    of the European Open Science Agenda and thus the needs for</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Assessing
    the potential of non-traditional metrics or &lsquo;altmetrics&rsquo; while considering
    matters of transparency and responsibility</li>\n\t<li>Creating the right incentives
    and rewards for a range of actors to engage in Open Science activities</li>\n\t<li>Developing
    guidelines for designing and implementing national policies and cross-national
    cooperation for Open Science.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Based on the outcomes of the MLE,
    I will then address several pressing issues and challenges of campaigning for
    Open Science and take up some of the topics that were discussed over the last
    days at this very conference, most importantly the questions, how we can ensure
    to measure what matters, and what is needed in terms of best practices and role
    models to foster a transition to Open Science that rests on close cooperation
    of all relevant actors in the STI ecosystem.</p>"

  title: Encouraging Collaboration between Citizens, Higher Education and Library
    Staff and Students through Open Knowledge and Open Innovation Activities
  description: |-
    <p>The INOS Project is an Erasmus+ project aiming to integrate Open Science and Citizen Science activities into active learning approaches in Higher Education Institutions (HEIs). In INOS, Open Science and Citizen Science activities are categorised as Open Knowledge Activities (OKAs) and Open Innovation Activities (OIAs). OKAs refer to activities that carry the principle of Open Knowledge i.e. &ldquo;any knowledge (either embodied in artefacts, in social practices, or in research outputs) that is freely circulated &ndash; without any legal, technological or social restriction&rdquo; (Open Knowledge Foundation, nd). Likewise, OIAs embody Open Innovation, which is &ldquo;to open up the innovation process to all active players so that knowledge can circulate more freely and be transformed into products and services&rdquo; (European Commission, 2016).</p>

    <p>By engaging citizens, HEI and library staff and students in OKAs and OIAs, INOS aims to increase the social impact of HEIs and libraries as knowledge creation, sharing and (re-)use ecosystems. During the project, the INOS consortium has developed a learning design framework and implementation guidelines for OKAs and OIAs with the aim to enhance their educational value and to support collaboration and co-creation among their participants. The proposed poster focuses on the OKAs and OIAs that the INOS partners are currently designing and implementing, including the general framework that these activities follow.</p>

    <p>The goal of the OKAs is to upskill academic and library staff and students connected to INOS project partners, through exposure to contemporary trends in public engagement and fostering active citizenship and social participation, by opening up university and university library pedagogical models to engagement with citizens.</p>

    <p>OIAs come downstream of open knowledge creation from OKAs, as their goal is to engage HEI staff and students in interdisciplinary activities with the aim to deliver an innovative solution to a technical challenge or social problem. Stakeholders outside the HEIs may also contribute to this endeavor. During these interdisciplinary activities, HEI participants from different disciplines get together, co-reflect, co-develop and apply their knowledge to address a problem drawn from observation or from previous knowledge.</p>

    <p>The OKAs and OIAs were initially planned as face-to-face activities that would take place at the premises of each project partner&rsquo;s university (with the exception of LIBER, who would hold their activities on the premises of four LIBER-member university libraries). Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, these activities are currently implemented online.</p>

    <p>The proposed poster will depict specific examples of the implemented activities, from design to evaluation. It will also address the following topics raised by the LIBER Call for Papers: Impact of Libraries, Open Knowledge, Open Innovation, Skill Development and Libraries&rsquo; role in Teaching and Learning.</p>

  description: |-
    <p>Many published findings in medicine and social sciences are difficult to replicate. To counteract this phenomenon, an increasing number of funding agencies and journals encourage or require data, materials, and analysis scripts associated with each publication. Consequently, researchers are turning to comprehensive services that facilitate collaborative workflow with colleagues and evaluators. One of the most popular is the Open Science Framework (<a href="https://osf.io/">OSF</a>), a free online platform that allows researchers to manage, document, and share the products of their research workflow at all stages, from the initial idea to the final report.</p>

    <p>The slides were used in an online workshop which was part of the <a href="http://www.nuigalway.ie/osw/">Open Scholarship Week 2020</a>. The slides are taken from a 2019 talk from Dr Schettino which was first published at <a href="https://osf.io/83u9x/">https://osf.io/83u9x/</a></p>

  title: 'Making Open Science transparent: the Bibliolabs project'
  description: "<p>Big Research Universities tend to have increasingly diversified
    sources of income. The threat is that for researchers, every funder having their
    own requirements and evaluation rules makes it hard and stressful to comply with
    each of them, and for citizens it often fosters opacity, preventing people to
    easily trace the funding schemes of science.</p>\n\n<p>One important source of
    income for research in recent years has been European funding, including ERC grants
    and projects in European Commission Framework Programs. Research funded by Europe
    offers an opportunity to enhance transparency towards citizen because Open Science
    is strongly incentivized, but it does not help researchers face the problem of
    diversity and opacity of funding sources and evaluation, since it adds the &lsquo;ethics&rsquo;
    and &lsquo;open science&rsquo; layers to the already intricate traditional bibliometrics
    used by supervisors.</p>\n\n<p>At the moment, our university offers to help any
    researcher that asks for it to prepare their application, obtain ERC grants and,
    once obtained, comply with the demands of these kinds of funding, like research
    data management and making their research open.</p>\n\n<p>By our project, we add
    a new, European facet to our bibliographic database, aiming to make use of the
    Open Data ecosystem to effectively support all researchers and not only those
    who ask for it. We combine three types of data that are available in our French
    context:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Open data (OpenAIRE, CORDIS from Europe, national
    references like RNSR, IDRef and HAL, European and non-European patent databases),</li>\n\t<li>Private
    data from traditional bibliometric companies (Scopus and Web of Science),</li>\n\t<li>Self-gathered
    data from our European projects support team.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This way, we will
    first automatically discover any grant or project in which one of our researchers
    might be involved by crawling CORDIS database, then contact them and get an answer
    on whether or not they need help on complying to Open science and research data
    management policies. Then we will be able to follow each project and see all the
    types of impacts European funding has, from the publications and research data
    produced to the patents filed and theses prepared thanks to it. We could then
    share it through our open linked-data environment.</p>\n\n<p>We then help:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Our
    supervisors to see the impact of our Open Science policies,</li>\n\t<li>Our European
    project support staff to easily find and contact researchers who might need help,</li>\n\t<li>By
    ricochet, our researchers and fellow citizens to produce and get access to a more
    open and better science.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>We hope to extend this initiative to
    all the projects funded in the Open data environment, like the French ANR projects,
    providing better support, easy and transparent evaluation and progressively making
    Open Science easier to produce for researchers and more transparent for all.</p>"

  title: A platform for mainstreaming citizen science and open science in Europe
  description: "<p>Main Idea<br>\nCitizen science is a prominent field of application
    for open science, and the two approaches have many strong synergies. These include:
    shared infrastructure and applications; advocating for the data and metadata generated
    through citizen science projects to be made publicly available (ECSA, 2015); supporting
    equitable collaboration between scientists and citizens (DITOs, 2017); and introducing
    new perspectives to science through public engagement (Ibid.).</p>\n\n<p>As a
    central platform for citizen science in Europe, EU-Citizen.Science will be a place
    for stakeholders and users to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>share, learn and initiate citizen
    science activities</li>\n\t<li>find and disseminate useful resources about citizen
    science (e.g. guidelines, best practices, training modules)</li>\n\t<li>make citizen
    science knowledge more accessible</li>\n\t<li>discover how to initiate their own
    citizen science activities</li>\n\t<li>support anyone involved with or interested
    in citizen science to learn more and get involved.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Practical
    relevance<br>\nBy supporting citizen science activities across Europe, the EU-Citizen.Science
    platform will strengthen open science by providing the infrastructure necessary
    for more people to engage with and learn about both approaches.<br>\nPractical
    relevance</p>\n\n<p>Innovative, scientific and/or societal impact<br>\nWhile several
    European countries have their own national platforms for citizen science, to date
    there is no European initiative to support these and strengthen the connections
    between them. EU-Citizen.Science will fulfil this role. It will strengthen citizen
    science and open science across Europe by enabling peer learning and the sharing
    of resources and expertise. Further, it will create a space for networking and
    interaction between the different stakeholder groups involved in citizen science
    and open science - including citizens, policy-makers, educators and scientists
    - helping to ensure that people can learn from each other, share findings and
    provide inputs to other projects. Our aim is for people from all walks of life
    to become more engaged with scientific processes.<br>\nInnovative, scientific
    and/or societal impact</p>\n\n<p>By advocating for, and supporting efforts to
    realise, greater citizen involvement in science, the platform supports wider efforts
    to strengthen science education and science communication. Studies show that involvement
    in citizen science projects can enhance public interest in science (Bonney et

  title: Open Source Workflow Systems in Life Sciences Informatics
  description: <p>A simple yet powerful programming tool enabling in silico experimentation,
    end-to-end data management through web services as well as use of grid and cloud
    processing power is scientific workflows. This technology is receiving considerable
    interest in recent years primarily due to its ability to promote and support scientific
    collaboration among large distributed research teams. The paper reviews the Scientific
    Workflows Management Systems (SWMS) field and investigates in detail popular open
    source workflow systems used commonly in life sciences informatics. Emphasis is
    placed on features which make these systems attractive for scientific use, e.g.
    user friendliness, use of distributed resources, reusability, provenance, collaboration,
    data integration, etc. Our conclusions indicate that although SWMS, including
    open source ones, have several open issues, their unique features and strong momentum
    clearly suggest that it is only a matter of time before they are adopted in even
    more scientific fields.</p>

    <p>In The Netherlands, <a href="https://www.openscience.nl/en">Open Science</a> has been (and still is) a hot topic of conversation among academics, funding agencies, universities, and politicians. However, implementing open and transparent scholarly practices is easier said than done: not only it requires time to learn new skills and tools (e.g., for data management or code sharing), but the rewards associated with such practices are not immediately quantifiable. Consequently, adoption among scholars has been slow.</p>

    <p>The <strong>Open Science Communities </strong>(OSCs) aim to increase awareness and accelerate the adoption of open and transparent scholarly practices. Armed with entrepreneurial spirit and a healthy dose of stubbornness, coordinators and members of these communities organize lectures, infosessions, <a href="https://ebm.bmj.com/content/22/6/232">journal clubs</a>, practical workshops, and informal gatherings discussing all aspects of open science, from preregistration of research proposals to open access publishing. Peer support is crucial not only for practical reasons (decentralization speeds up adoption), but also to show researchers that their colleagues value such efforts.</p>

    <p>Open Science Communities are now recognized and progressively institutionalized, as our experiences in <a href="https://www.openscience-rotterdam.com/home/">Rotterdam </a>and <a href="https://openscience-utrecht.com/">Utrecht </a>can attest. <a href="http://www.nuigalway.ie/osw/">Open Scholarship Community Galway </a>opened a new exciting internationalization chapter. The ultimate goal is a global cultural shift in academia, from closeness and individualism towards transparency and collaboration.</p>

    &quot;ecosystem of infrastructures&quot;, namely the European Open Science Cloud
    (EOSC). We will highlight how the SSH Open Science infrastructures contribute
    to the goal of establishing the EOSC. First, through the example of OPERAS, the
    European Research Infrastructure for Open Scholarly Communication in the SSH,
    to see how its services are conceived to be part of the EOSC and to address the
    communities&#39; needs. The next two sections highlight collaboration practices
    between partners in Europe to build the SSH component of the EOSC and a SSH discovery
    platform, as a service of OPERAS and the EOSC. The last two sections will focus
    on an implementation network dedicated to SSH data fairification.</p>

  title: '[8] The Use Case Austria – Towards the European Open Science Cloud: Research
    libraries taking leadership in forming digital research infrastructures on a national
    scale'
  description: "<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;Open Science requires a coherent
    data and research infrastructure system, and libraries are major players in this
    system.</p>\n\n<p>The European Commission is a promoter of the European Open Science
    Cloud. The EOSC is not an actual cloud service, but rather a kind of reengineering
    of existing e-infrastructures based on scientific data and related services, with
    modest international guidance and governance, and a large degree of freedom regarding
    practical implementation.</p>\n\n<p>According to a presentation by J.C. Burgelman
    at the e-IRG workshop on June 3, 2015 entitled &ldquo;Open Science policy: Results
    of the consultation on &lsquo;Science 2.0: Science in transition&rsquo; and possible
    follow up,&rdquo; the EOSC is composed of three layers, representing governance,
    services and data. Each layer is assigned essential elements. The EOSC is a complex
    ecosystem of ICT services for scientific research, whereby the main stakeholders
    include libraries, ICT, research support services, legal services, funders and
    corporations. Users of EOSC services (e.g. from the scientific community) enjoy
    the freedom to choose the services they need, and providers have the freedom to
    innovate. Key elements of the EOSC include good governance, policies, rules of
    engagement, cross-disciplinary services, compliance with legal and ethical requirements,
    and the fulfilment of the FAIR principles.</p>\n\n<p>This paper provides insight
    into the &ldquo;Use Case Austria.&rdquo; Currently in Austria, there are six national,
    publicly-funded cooperative projects in place supporting the Amsterdam Call for
    Action on Open Science. These are six transversal projects covering governance,
    service, data and infrastructure, and all comply with the requirements of the
    EOSC. Four of these six projects were initiated by Austrian research libraries,
    and five of which provide the core facilities for the development of these projects.
    In each of the four projects, libraries show their ability to respond to important
    questions concerning their new roles (leading in strategy and innovation, supporting
    sustainability, creating new and visionary settings, showing leadership, building
    capacity, and implementing knowledge of research data management and project management).
    This paper provides insight into the planning, implementation and evaluation of
    this ambitious undertaking and presents the current state of these projects, offering
    findings that may have an impact on the wider library community.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore,
    the experience gained could serve as a basis for further development in the context
    of existing e-infrastructures, research data policies and strategies.</p>\n\n<p>The

  title: 'ON-MERRIT D4.1 Information Seeking Behaviour and Open Science Uptake in
    Industry: A Literature Review'
  description: |-
    <p>Spurring growth and innovation in SMEs is a key goal of policy-makers. A commonly stated advantage of Open Access to publications and data is greater return on investment for funders, as results are made re-usable to a range of societal actors including industry. Is open research data actually being taken up by industry, though? This deliverable report addresses this broad question by semi-systematically summarizing the evidence to date on how scholarly resources are used in industry, with a special focus on open science practices.<br>
    Crucial for understanding whether industrial actors are able to benefit from open science resources such as research papers or data is the concept of absorptive capacity, that is the ability of a firm to recognize the value of new, external information, assimilate it, and apply it to commercial ends. Recent research has highlighted that particularly SMEs struggle in benefiting from Open Data. Increasing absorptive capacity among industrial actors thus plays an important role in increasing the overall uptake of scientific resources.<br>
    Finding relevant resources is a crucial step in recognizing and assimilating new external information. The deliverable presents a systematic review of the evidence on how companies satisfy their information needs. Common barriers in this regard include difficulties in explicating the information needs and finding relevant information, as well as lack of time, accessibility and content quality.&nbsp;<br>
    The literature on information seeking behaviours among industrial actors indicates that research outputs currently play a somewhat peripheral role in general information-seeking behaviour in many industrial sectors. The evidence collected points to a general lack of information-seeking skills amongst employees. Exploiting scientific resources for commercial needs also requires skills specific to the subject area. Companies commonly acquire these skills by either hiring graduates or directly collaborating with academia. Open access to research findings is found to provide efficiency gains, as well as enabling the development of new products, services, and companies, by lowering the barriers for companies of all sizes for accessing basic research.<br>
    The evidence assembled in this deliverable report lays the groundwork for the planned activities the&nbsp;project: the investigation of the uptake of the open science resources in industry with a stakeholder map, contextual inquiries and a questionnaire study; the investigation of the uptake of open science resources in industry through the analysis of patents.</p>

  title: A Collection of Open Science Use Cases on Societal Engagement
  description: |-
    <p>2022 OPEN SCIENCE AWARDS</p>

    <p>In the context of the Netherlands National Open Science Festival 2022 a call for Use Cases for the Open Science Awards was published, allowing all researchers and Phd students from Dutch universities, universities of applies sciences, UMCs and research institutes to submit their use case. The Open Science Awards recognise and reward researchers or research students who have used Open Science to make their research more accessible, transparent or reproducible.</p>

    <p>This collection of Use Cases is the result of this call.</p>

    <p>In 2022 the focus of the Awards lied on Societal Engagement, one of the key pillars of Open Science. The call was looking for use cases that explored challenges and difficulties as well as positive experiences and successful outcomes.</p>

    <p>As defined in the UNESCO Recommendations for Open Science, societal engagement and the engagement of societal actors refers to &ldquo;extended collaboration between scientists and societal actors beyond the scientific community, by opening up practices and tools that are part of the research cycle and by making the scientific process more inclusive and accessible to the broader inquiring society based on new forms of collaboration and work such as crowdfunding, crowdsourcing and scientific volunteering.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Methods for achieving societal engagement can include:</p>

    <p>&bull; Citizen and community involvement in the generation of knowledge;</p>

    <p>&bull; Dialogue between scientists, policymakers and practitioners, entrepreneurs and community members during the research process such that they can voice their concerns, needs and aspirations;</p>

    <p>&bull; Citizen science and the co-creative participation of citizens or societal partners at any stage of the research process;</p>

    <p>&bull; Inclusion of other knowledge systems, lay knowledge or traditional knowledge within the research process.</p>

    <p>All use cases in this collection included at least one out of these methods. The Festival programme committee awarded five use cases with an award; all of those winners made an extensive effort to open up their research practices that are part of the research cycle, making their scientific process more inclusive by doing so.</p>

    <p><strong>Research data management is an issue that is not yet well addressed in academic teaching, especially in low income countries. However, its necessity is more and more recognized, especially in the context of research reproducibility, data management plans and the recent multiplication of works related to the emergence of artificial intelligence.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Since 2020, two Malagasy institutes, the Institute of fisheries and marine science ( IH.SM) and the National Centre Oceanographic Researches ( CNRO), have joined forces with teams from the French Institute for Sustainable Development (IRD) to create the MIKAROKA International Mixed Laboratory (LMI) in order to create a functional and sustainable observation platform for coastal marine biodiversity and its uses in Madagascar. One of the strong objectives of the Laboratory is to support partners in strengthening their research and training capacities.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>The idea of the open science oriented training workshop came from the data management team of the Laboratory and was funded by the Structuring Training Project (PSF) program of IRD in 2021.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Malgasy students and researchers in the marine doman will be invited to attend this training workshop to acquire additional data skills dealing with open science and FAIR management of research data. The workshop should occur in december 2021 and will bring together data specialists from domains such as Nagoya protocols, Biodiversity data management and data warehouses. Feedbacks from researchers on several systems of data valorization will also be proposed as well as tutorials on the implementation of data processing chains.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Workshop content, such as video captures of sessions, presentation materials, code, tutorials, and shared notes, will be made openly available to all through a publication/repository in the DataSuds data warehouse using DOIs. The entire training will also be made available online using an (open source) online digital resource sharing platform.</strong></p>

  title: The Varying Openness of Digital Open Science Tools
  description: |-
    <p>Digital tools that support Open Science practices play a key role in the seamless accumulation, archiving and dissemination of scholarly data, outcomes and conclusions. Despite their integration into Open Science practices, the providence and design of these digital tools are rarely explicitly scrutinized. This means that influential factors, such as the funding models of the parent organizations, their geographic location, and the dependency on digital infrastructures are rarely considered. Suggestions from literature and anecdotal evidence already draw attention to the impact of these factors, and raise the question of whether the Open Science ecosystem can realise the aspiration to become a truly &ldquo;unlimited digital commons&rdquo; in its current structure.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>In an online research approach, we compiled and analysed the geolocation, terms and conditions as well as funding models of 242 digital tools increasingly being used by researchers in various disciplines. Our findings indicate that design decisions and restrictions are biased towards researchers in North American and European scholarly communities. In order to make the future Open Science ecosystem inclusive and operable for researchers in all world regions including Africa, Latin America, Asia and Oceania, those should be actively included in design decision processes.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Digital Open Science Tools carry the promise of enabling collaboration across disciplines, world regions and language groups through responsive design. We therefore encourage long term funding mechanisms and ethnically as well as culturally inclusive approaches serving local prerequisites and conditions to tool design and construction allowing a globally connected digital research infrastructure to evolve in a regionally balanced manner.</p>

    2021 the EGI Federation leads the &lsquo;EGI Advanced Compute Services for the
    European Open Science Cloud (EGI-ACE)&rsquo; European Commission co-funded project
    [2]. EGI-ACE delivers the Compute Platform for the European Open Science Cloud
    (EOSC CP). The EOSC CP is a system of federated compute and storage facilities,
    complemented by diverse access, data management and compute platform services
    for Open Science.</p>\n\n<p>The EOSC CP is designed to support a wide range of
    scientific data processing and analysis use cases, including reproducible data
    intensive sciences. This use case primarily relies on the EGI Notebooks and EGI
    Binder services that are both build on well-known open source technologies, customized
    for international big data communities and for members of the long tail of science.</p>\n\n<p>EGI
    Notebooks [3] is based on the Jupyter technology, offering a browser-based tool
    for interactive data analysis. EGI Notebooks provides users with computational
    notebooks where they can combine text, mathematics, computations and rich media
    output. EGI Notebooks is a multi-user service with dedicated service instances
    for each user community, with such a instance shared among all the members of
    one community. EGI Notebooks service instances are hosted on the EGI Cloud [4],
    i.e. on OpenStack sites that participate in the EGI federation, sharing common
    single sign-on, availability/reliability monitoring, Virtual Machine image catalogue,
    usage accounting, security incident response team, and user helpdesk.</p>\n\n<p>EGI
    Notebooks provides the following custom features compared to other Jupyter systems:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Integration
    with EGI Check-in, allowing login with EduGAIN or social accounts (e.g. Google,
    Facebook).</li>\n\t<li>Persistent storage and scalable compute capacity allocated
    for each user at a per community level.</li>\n\t<li>Access to distributed cloud
    storage from the Notebooks via the EGI DataHub service [5].</li>\n\t<li>Customisable
    with community libraries and programming languages (e.g. MATLAB).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>EGI
    Binder [5] allows the re-creation of custom computing environments from a single
    link, to reproduce notebooks. EGI Binder builds on BinderHub, an open source tool
    that allows to build docker images from a Git repository and then make it available
    from JupyterHub. EGI Binder was customized by EGI for scientific communities similarly
    to the Notebooks service.</p>\n\n<p>EGI Notebooks and Binder enable the following
    reproducibility process (See Figure 1.):</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Users can define their
    big data analysis in the EGI Notebooks service.</li>\n\t<li>Once a notebook is
    ready for publishing, it can be shared in a GitHub repository.</li>\n\t<li>Users
    can use the Zenodo-GitHub integration for generating DOIs for a notebook. The
    DOI can be cited in publications for discovery in research papers by fellow researchers.</li>\n\t<li>The
    GitHub link or the Zenodo DOI can be used to reproduce the same computational
    analysis in EGI Binder. The analysis can be re-run and advanced in Binder, paving
    the way for new discoveries.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>ACKNOWLEDGEMENT</p>\n\n<p>The work

  description: |-
    <p>Software has become an indissociable support of technical and scientific knowledge.<br>
    The preservation of this universal body of knowledge is as essential as preserving<br>
    research articles and data sets. In the quest to make scientific results reproducible, and<br>
    pass knowledge to future generations, we must preserve these three main pillars:<br>
    research articles that describe the results, the data sets used or produced, and the<br>
    &nbsp;software that embodies the logic of the data transformation.</p>

    Communication (CCSD) 2 and the scientific and technical information services (IES 3 ) of<br>
    The French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation (Inria) 4 has<br>
    resulted in a specified moderation and curation workflow for research software artifacts<br>
    deposited in the HAL 5 open access repository. The curation workflow was developed to<br>
    help digital librarians and archivists handle this new and peculiar artifact - software<br>

  title: 'Windbench: Building Trust on Wind Energy Design Tools through Open Science
    Model Evaluation'
  description: "<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Windbench portal has
    been developed together with the IEA-Wind Task 31 &ldquo;Wakebench&rdquo; Wind
    Energy Model Evaluation Protocol (WEMEP) to promote interdisciplinary research
    in the development of integrated design tools. Due to the high complexity of the
    multi-scale wind energy system, a building-block validation process is required
    to systematically test model adequacy based on fit-to-purpose metrics across a
    wide range of wind conditions.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Value Proposition</strong></p>\n\n<p>Windbench
    focuses primarily on model developer needs while also engaging with researchers
    involved in the design of experiments and generation of validation datasets. End-users
    from industry use Windbench to judge the adequacy of the models underlying their
    design tools. The value proposition for these users is:</p>\n\n<p><em>Validate
    your code together with your peers and share your data safely to contribute to
    a traceable international model evaluation framework for the development of trustful
    wind energy engineering tools. </em></p>\n\n<p>This is rolled out into the following
    features that lead the new design of Windbench:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>A community
    platform to map and document the development an international wind energy modeling
    and evaluation framework.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>A validation directed research
    program to establish high-level priorities for experimental analysis, model development
    and evaluation to meet the requirements of wind energy applications.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>A
    guide to adopt formal model evaluation procedures and data standards to improve
    the traceability and interoperability of the framework.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>A
    gateway to open-access resources for modeling, data analysis and validation.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>A
    forum to discuss industry challenges and scientific insights that help identify
    knowledge gaps.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>\n\n<p>Windbench
    will orchestrate general-purpose services around the SeaDataCloud virtual research
    environment (VRE), a data analytics platform that allows users to run benchmarking
    activities powered by the EUDAT Collaborative Data Infrastructure. Jupyter notebooks
    will be integrated in the WEMEP using sphinx-based documentation through Github
    repositories, published in Zenodo for version control. Benchmark data repositories
    will be shared and exploited through EUDAT data management services integrated
    with the SeaDataCloud to adopt policies and standards that promote data interoperability.
    Potential contributions to the WEMEP will be discussed online through The Wind
    Vane Blog, a publication hosted by Medium to promote the exchange of scientific
    insights and challenges between wind energy researchers and industry.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Testing
    Plans</strong></p>\n\n<p>Windbench is developed alongside the third phase of the
    IEA Wind Task 31 with support from the H2020-MARINET2 project (grant agreement
    number 73108). Over the next three years the integration of Windbench in the SeaDataCloud
    VRE will be enabled and tested with use cases from MARINET2 calls for access to
    e-infrastructures as well as other parallel projects under the umbrella of the
    IEA Wind. Solution testing with early adopters will focus on developing critical
    components that lead to adoption (communities engaged, benchmarks produced, users
    producing content, etc). This will ultimately depend on an actionable model evaluation
    protocol that promotes validation repositories that follow FAIR principles on
    data that are findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Summary</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>We
    present a prototype for the new design of Windbench, a service to manage benchmarking
    activities for verification and validation of wind energy models. Windbench addresses
    model developers, experimentalists and end-users from industry through an actionable
    model evaluation protocol that promotes data sharing and trust. This will be powered
    by a virtual research environment built on the SeaDataCloud to provide data analytics
    around benchmark repositories managed in the EUDAT data management ecosystem.
    Key performance indicators will be based on quantifying user adoption as well
    as assessing the FAIRification of the data as outlined in the GO FAIR initiative.</p>"

  title: A Bibliometric study of the Literature of Open Science & Open Access
  description: |-
    <p>One of the necessary cultural changes on the way to Open Science is the commitment to its principles. Both the LIBER and LERU Roadmaps underline the importance of adopting consistent and robust practices that exemplify the benefits of Open Science. However, in the past several contradictions have been recorded, like for instance that many readers have encountered access fees on articles that discuss Open Access issues, as those were published in paywalled journals. It is important that every part of the discourse for Open Science to remain open and accessible to anyone who wishes to contribute. Therefore, gradually and steadily, a question is raised: what are the attributes of the literature about Open Access and Open Science?</p>

    <p>In this paper, we performed a three-tiered micro-analysis study of 2390 publications that focus on Open Science and Open Access, as indexed in Web of Science, in order to see how this literature has developed over the last twenty years. Initially, we were interested in finding how many of these publications were published openly and in which version, namely green, gold or bronze. However, using the open programming language Python, we conducted analyses to further explore the landscape of this literature and we were able to find the key figures that describe its growth rate and several other statistical measures on information, like the main journal venues and authors. We also calculated statistical measures of the types of these publications and whether they were financially supported or not. In the second tier of our analysis, we produced timelines that reflect the temporal progress of authors, journals and descriptors, starting from a time point shortly after the Santa Fe Declaration of Open Access. Finally, in the third tier, we produced networks of entities and performed analyses to identify the main authorship models, which together with other indicators, show if collaboration fosters in this literature and how its main entities are linked together. The study offers a thorough and detailed view on the bibliometric aspects of the &ldquo;Open&rdquo; literature conducted by open, transparent and reproducible tools.</p>

    <p>This talk was given at University of Colorado Boulder on 11 October 2019, as part of the&nbsp;<a href="http://boulderfluidsseminar.org">Boulder Fluid and Thermal Sciences Seminar Series</a>.</p>

    <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>

    <p>This talk will provide an overview of how to practice open science in your research: making your publications open access, archiving your data openly, and sharing your open-source research software. Open-science practices are important to ensure the results of research, and in particular publicly funded research, are accessible to all, to make findings reproducible and thus more convincing, and to magnify the impact of your work. Topics to be discussed include how and when to publish preprints or eprints; copyright and licensing issues; how, why, and where to archive your data; how, why, and where to release your software; how to cite data and software (and make yours easily citable); and tools to help make your work reproducible, including Jupyter notebooks. Finally, the talk will conclude with the benefits of doing all this (extra) open work.</p>

  title: Federal Open Agent System Platform
  description: |-
    Open Agent System platform based on High Level
    Architecture is firstly proposed to support the application involving
    heterogeneous agents. The basic idea is to develop different wrappers
    for different agent systems, which are wrapped as federates to join a
    federation. The platform is based on High Level Architecture and the
    advantages for this open standard are naturally inherited, such as
    system interoperability and reuse. Especially, the federal architecture
    allows different federates to be heterogeneous so as to support the
    integration of different agent systems. Furthermore, both implicit
    communication and explicit communication between agents can be
    supported. Then, as the wrapper RTI_JADE an example, the
    components are discussed. Finally, the performance of RTI_JADE is
    analyzed. The results show that RTI_JADE works very efficiently.

    <p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>

    <p>Open Science, as defined by UNESCO&rsquo;s Recommendation approved November 2021, states it as &ldquo;an inclusive construct that combines various movements and practices aiming to make multilingual scientific knowledge openly available, accessible and reusable for everyone, to increase scientific collaborations and sharing of information for the benefits of science and society&rdquo;. The key pillars start with &ldquo;open scientific knowledge&rdquo; that includes scientific publications, research data, open-source software and source code, and hardware.&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    As publishers we have an opportunity, perhaps even an invitation, to better collaborate with scientific data repositories, software development platforms, and hardware manufacturers to consider what the workflows of open science could and should enable for researchers and ways we can help support these efforts.&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    In this session we will explore the anticipated benefits that Open Science will have on complex cross-domain challenges, bringing more inclusion and equity for researchers in low- and middle-income countries, and encourage more co-design and co-development of research efforts with those impacted by the research outcomes.</p>

  title: Open Science - Where do we go from here?
  description: "<p>Open Science: Where do we go from here?</p>\n\n<p>Dr. Katja Mayer,
    Center for Social Innovation, Vienna, Austria</p>\n\n<p>When looking at the calendar
    for events under the 2018 Austrian presidency of the European Union, we get the
    impression Open Science is dominating the STI agenda and research policy discussions.
    However, when we look around us here in Austria, we see a lot of wonderful initiatives
    and bottom-up activities, but only rarely we face real political commitment, and
    definitely no sustainable visibility on national policy level yet. Whereas there
    is a strong push from the EU to foster a multi-dimensional transition to Open
    Science, there is no common baseline for how to implement Open Science nationally.
    In my talk I will report on the outcomes of mutual learning exercise (MLE) that
    was set up by the Commission and 13 countries to address this. In this Open Science
    MLE we embraced a hands-on, &lsquo;learning by doing&rsquo; approach supported
    by external expertise. Concrete examples, models, best practices and knowledge
    exchanges fostered broader understanding of the implications and benefits of Open
    Science strategies, covering key elements of the European Open Science Agenda
    and thus the needs for</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Assessing the potential of non-traditional
    metrics or &lsquo;altmetrics&rsquo; while considering matters of transparency
    and responsibility;</li>\n\t<li>Creating the right incentives and rewards for
    a range of actors to engage in Open Science activities;</li>\n\t<li>Developing
    guidelines for designing and implementing national policies and cross-national
    cooperation for Open Science.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Based on the outcomes of the MLE
    I will then address several pressing issues of successfully campaigning for Open
    Science and take up some of the topics that were discussed over the last days
    at this very conference, most importantly the questions, how we can ensure to
    measure what matters, and what is needed in terms of best practices and role models
    to foster a transition to Open Science that rests on close cooperation of all
    relevant actors in the STI ecosystem.</p>"

  title: université Paris Nanterre Open science strategy 2022-09-27
  description: |-
    <p>As the dissemination of knowledge and scientific influence are structuring values of the universit&eacute; Paris Nanterre, the institution wished to adopt an open science policy in 2021, the year of publication of the French second National Plan for Open Science. The challenge for the university is to develop a political vision on this subject that is specific to its context, and to determine a strategy that is collectively supported by the departments concerned.</p>

    <p>On the organisational, networking and partnerships aspects:&nbsp; this paper will display how the universit&eacute; Paris Nanterre has been developing strong transversality between decision-makers, research department and library services in order to multiply and structure collaborations, and then included them in its organisation in a sustainable manner. This paper will underline how the development of its open science strategy has also strengthened the collaboration between the institution and other actors in the region or among the institution&#39;s partners in the open science and FAIR research data fields, but also helped opening up concerted partnerships with external actors in complementary fields such as open educational resources and OpenData.</p>

    <p>On the human resources and interservice collaborative aspects: this paper will showcase how designing an ambitious strategy and implementing coherent and collaborative services related to open science in a sustainable perspective of internal and external collaborations led the universit&eacute; Paris Nanterre to break down traditional frameworks of professional silos, and rethink traditional missions according to a bold and prospective vision.</p>

  title: 'University Journals: Consolidating Institutional Repositories in a Free
    Open Access Publication Platform'
  description: |-
    <p>Funders increasingly mandate researchers to publish their scientific articles open access and to retain their copyright. Universities all over the world use repositories for the preservation and dissemination of academic production of their institutions, including scientific articles, datasets, and other research outputs. However, in general, authors do not find institutional repositories very attractive and accessible as an open access publication platform since repositories are not part of the rewarding system. We expect that researchers are more likely to publish and deposit their scientific papers in a repository, once they have the appearance, recognition and dissemination of a scientific journal.</p>

    <p>University libraries from five European countries started a collaboration to set up&nbsp;<em>University Journals</em>&nbsp;as an alternative to the current journal system that require authors to transfer their copyright, or charge article processing charges. If a scientific paper in a repository is submitted to and accepted by&nbsp;<em>University Journals</em>, the article will be automatically transformed into a publication in this newly accredited platform. By building on the existing repository infrastructure and publishing expertise of the participating universities,&nbsp;<em>University Journals</em>&nbsp;requires only modest resources, while the journal format will help ensure the commitment and acceptance by academic authors.</p>

    <p><em>University Journals</em>&nbsp;will also stimulate Open Science practices.&nbsp;<em>All</em>&nbsp;research output (reports, datasets, tests, protocols, methods, software and other research products) can be published quickly and fully in&nbsp;<em>University Journals</em>. The advantage is that all types of publications will be indexed in the same way in established abstract and citation databases, by current search engines and copyright and ownership of all research outcomes will remain within the universities. And although&nbsp;<em>University Journals</em>&nbsp;is a single publication platform, it will be given the appearance of various digital journals, organized by discipline and university. It will provide a valuable way of modern scholarly communication as demanded in the transition to Open Science.</p>

    <p>In 2019, we received a starting grant to establish&nbsp;<em>University Journals</em>. Fourteen universities will collaboratively set up the publication and dissemination process. Publication will rely on internal quality control, while peer review will be voluntary, post hoc, open and transparent. Management and editorial tasks will be delegated to the libraries. A first (beta)version of the platform is scheduled to be online by June 2020. There is an open invitation for other universities to join the collaboration.</p>

    <p>The platform will co-exist with commercial journals, but academic and research libraries gain control of the publication and dissemination process on behalf of the authors and institutions. The costs of the common infrastructure can be shared among participating universities and possibly other stakeholders such as national funding agencies and governments.</p>

    <p>This paper will explain the&nbsp;<em>University Journals</em>&nbsp;project and how the involved universities want to facilitate a valuable alternative publication platform that complies with Plan S principles and enables publication and dissemination of all research outcomes. By establishing&nbsp;<em>University Journals</em>&nbsp;as a publication platform, university libraries are instrumental (and crucial) in achieving the ambitions of Open Science.</p>

  title: Open Science Practices – a theoretical reflection
  description: |-
    <p>Purpose of this paper<br>
    More and more articles discussing a &ldquo;crisis of science&rdquo; (Saltelli &amp; Funtowicz, 2017). The crisis is identified by seven symptoms: First, the replication crisis, which means that published studies cannot be replicated by other researchers or lead to different results (Open Science Collaboration, 2015). Second, the deficit in statistical training and good statistical designs/models (Young, 2018) which for example leads to not useful research in medicine (Ioannidis, 2016). Third, the manipulation of p-values (or &#39;p-hacking&#39;) is identified as a problem. For example, Simmons et al. (2011) state: &rdquo;In many cases, a researcher is more likely to falsely find evidence that an effect exists than to correctly find evidence that it does not.&rdquo; Since only positive and significant results are published results in the creation of a bias in scientific literature (Bruner &amp; Holman, 2019). Fourth, &rdquo;journal-based metrics, such as journal impact factors, should not be taken as a surrogate measure for the quality of research, and, above all, should not be used in hiring, promotion, or funding decisions.&rdquo; (Ioannidis, 2014) At the same time, especially early career scientists must comply to the metric system if they want to survive in academia (Fanelli, 2009). Fifth, complying with the metric system implies publishing in peer reviewed journals, which according to Frey (2003) is tantamount to prostitution: &rdquo;Authors only get their papers accepted if they intellectually prostitute themselves by slavishly following the demands made by anonymous referees who have no property rights to the journals they advise.&rdquo; Sixth, the metric system motivates scientists to producing as many articles as possible, which leads to the &ldquo;publish or perish&rdquo; effect of splitting research into as small parts as possible (Saltelli &amp; Funtowicz, 2017). Seventh, Fanelli (2009) refers to a poll in which 2/3 of the interviewed scientists &ldquo;admitted having recurred to &lsquo;questionable&rsquo; research practices&rdquo; because of the publish<br>
    or perish culture. In sum, these symptoms contribute to science being under increasing pressure as the &rdquo;public trust in the evidence produced by science and its institutions&ldquo; decreases (Saltelli &amp; Funtowicz, 2017<br>
    ).&nbsp;So far, little has changed in the practices of scientists, even though politics exerts pressure, for example by linking funding to the re-use of data (Horizon 2020) or by open access strategies (Plan S). However, and this is the thesis of this paper, scientific practices will only change connected to disciplinary cultures (Becher, 1981) and their values, norms and patterns of acting, thinking and perceiving (Bourdieu, 1977).&nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>Report</strong></p>

    <p>This study examines the creation and adoption of OER in the Geosciences with a goal of providing guidance for institutions, libraries and librarians who support and fund OER initiatives. An environmental scan, employed to identify and characterize available college-level OER in this discipline, provided a baseline for the study. Analysis of the scan along with a review of OER, textbook and field guide standards informs a new set of proposed guidelines for Geoscience OER. This work will describe these guidelines and offer a call for community feedback.</p>

    <p><strong>Imagine an Ideal Open Science academic world &ndash; no matter what the level of excellency and research field, researchers all follow similar research cycles: read &ndash; get funding &ndash; work &ndash; finish &ndash; (patent) &ndash; publish &ndash; and &hellip; disseminate? There is an Open Science challenge at every stage:</strong></p>

    <p><em>Read</em>&nbsp;&ndash; follow OA publications, repositories, DOAJ, use open data.</p>

    <p><em>Get funding</em>&nbsp;&ndash; funder&rsquo;s OA policy, OA text and data requirements.</p>

    <p><em>Work</em>&nbsp;&ndash; communicate, cooperate, share data, methodologies, collect and analyse results.</p>

    <p><em>Finish and publish</em>&nbsp;&ndash; select medium to publish in; meet funder&rsquo;s requirements, R&amp;D assessment requirements and institutional OA policies.</p>

    <p><em>Patent</em>&nbsp;brings information embargo during the research process; a significant aspect with regard to Open Science.</p>

    <p><em>Disseminate</em>&nbsp;&ndash; self-archive, disseminate research results via Green OA &ndash; repositories, social networks, data repositories, etc.</p>

    <p>Based on the SPARC Europe Checklist, we have not come far. We have laid solid foundations by implementing parts of Open Science, but some aspects, including user motivation are &lsquo;sci-fi&rsquo; for us. We run a repository connected to the University and international infrastructures; we provide OA publishing guidance, including Horizon 2020 requirements; we support ORCID identification; and we help researchers promote their work by OA publishing, self-archiving, data sharing and social networks. We do our best to teach PhD students e-research principles, OA, Open Science, publishing standards, etc. in normal classes as well as through single lectures.</p>

    <p>There are many challenges within Open Science. Some aspects, however, are not within the Library&rsquo;s competencies, so our role is partly one of coordination. We tend to be ahead of our University demands, foresee trends in Open Science publishing and policies, and need to get support by the University management. As such we would need to push implementing institutional and national OA policies, CC licensing, data repositories, open educational materials, etc.</p>

    <p>We want to help researchers to get more out of Open Science/OA than they are able at this point. Now, we intend to focus on more aspects of Open Science during the research cycle, on open communication, Open Access publishing and dissemination of research results. We do have success with individual researchers and journal editors. We wish to motivate more pioneers and show that Open Science is a step towards excellence. We need to open their eyes and minds to Open Science to open their opportunities to survive in today&rsquo;s academic world.</p>

  title: Case studies on Open Science in the context of ERC projects - Set 1
  description: "<p>This document presents the first of five sets of case studies that
    have been produced in the framework of the <em>&lsquo;Study on open access to
    publications and research data management and sharing within ERC projects&rsquo;.
    </em>This study has been procured by the ERC Executive Agency under contract number
    ERCEA/A1/2016/06.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The following three case studies are included
    in this set:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>The Epistemology of data-intensive science (DATA
    SCIENCE)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In the <a href=\"http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/110403_en.html\">Data
    Science</a> project, Professor Sabina Leonelli and her team at the University
    of Exeter are showing how social science and humanities researchers can embrace
    open science, while respecting their ethical and confidentiality commitments to
    research subjects and participants. Key ingredients include creative and positive
    thinking about what can be shared, negotiating participants&rsquo; consent to
    share, documenting the interpretive process so others may follow it, and forward
    planning of the time to prepare interview materials for sharing. &nbsp;Openness
    is not just its own reward; it brings new opportunities to influence policy networks,
    as Professor Leonelli demonstrates.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>WORDS FOR ART : The rise
    of a terminology in Europe (1600-1750) (LEXART)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Leading the
    <a href=\"http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/107825_en.html\">LexArt</a> project,
    Professor Mich&egrave;le-Caroline Heck from the Universit&eacute; Paul-Val&eacute;ry
    Montpellier had to find viable solutions for the development of a highly complex
    database and for high open access publishing costs for books that had not been
    included in the initial budget. The issues related to the database were solved
    by partnering with the Trier Center for Digital Humanities, who had the necessary
    expertise, and collaborating with them in a virtual research environment. The
    LexArt team also succeeded in making all their books open access and staying within
    the budget by choosing the Presses Universitaires de la M&eacute;diterran&eacute;e,
    a university press, instead of other commercial publishers.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>The
    Metallurgical Nutcracker: Probing at the Nanoscale the Structure and Properties
    of Hard Second Phases in Alloys and Composites (PHASENANOCRACKER)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Professor

    led the <a href=\"http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/102187_en.html\">PhaseNanoCracker</a>
    project that was conducted in the fields of material chemistry and metallurgy.
    Although this is not a widespread practice in these fields of science, all the
    articles coming out of the project were published in open access. Professor Mortensen
    and his team believe that it is important to make research results accessible
    and available for everyone, even though it is not encouraged by the current scientific
    publishing enterprise.</p>"

  title: Supporting Researchers on Open Science from Building a Research Project to
    its End
  description: |-
    <p>As emphasized by the recently published Plan S, more and more funders have implemented open science policies to require that funded projects disseminate openly their publications, write a data management plan and open their research data when possible. However, since many funders do not ask a detailed presentation of an open science strategy at the submission stage of research projects, most of the researchers do not seriously consider these matters when building their project. Once the project is accepted, it may be difficult to comply with open science policies if no appropriate resources are dedicated to data preservation and dissemination or if ethics and legal matters have not been anticipated enough to balance data protection and dissemination. Open science requirements then appear to be only some administrative obligations.</p>

    <p>Our University Library implemented a new service to support researchers when building their projects to take into account all dimensions of open science. We help researchers to transform their open science obligations in terms of objectives, deliverables and budget in their proposal. We also draft a dissemination strategy fitted for each project supported. We make sure open science objectives and resources are well balanced. This support has shown to be appreciated by project reviewers.</p>

    <p>When a project is funded, the Library helps researchers to put their commitments and strategy into practice. A librarian is designated as the project open science manager. He/she provides the project coordinator with guidelines and informs and trains the project stakeholders on open access and data management at the kick-off meeting and other working meetings. The project open science manager also monitors open access dissemination of research results. For mid-term and final reporting, the librarian produces a report on publications which includes information on open access dissemination, impact&hellip; Help is provided to write the data management plan and specific guidance is proposed so that researchers are able to make relevant choices to manage their research data.</p>

    <p>Supporting researchers in a project-oriented perspective at the submission stage has proved to be an efficient way for librarians to be considered as a partner by project coordinators. It enables the Library to work with very dynamic researchers who have a driving force to reach more widely research communities about open science. Based on concrete and interdisciplinary examples, our presentation will describe which specific services can be offered to research project coordinators. We will highlight the positive impact of these services on the recognition of the Library&rsquo;s role on supporting research. We will introduce how we implemented this approach in collaboration with other University services such as the research coordination office or the data protection officer. A specific focus will be made on new skills needed by librarians to develop such services.</p>

    <p>Our Library mainly works with European H2020 projects and with projects funded by the French National Agency for Research (ANR) but this presentation should be of interest for participants regardless of their national context since open science requirements are more and more widely spread.</p>

  title: Software Engineering has a Cost! A Shared Open-Source Customizable Codebase
    for Scientific Data Management
  description: <p>Sharing and reusing diverse collections of data is essential to
    scientific discoveries in many domains, in particular where data and tools must
    span multiple domains. To support these needs effectively new methods are required
    that simplify the amount of effort needed by researchers to find and utilize data,
    support community accepted data practices, and bring together the breadth of standards,
    tools, and resources utilized by a community. Clowder addresses these challenges
    by distributing the data curation overhead throughout the lifecycle of the data,
    interacting with and utilizing a variety of community tools, while also supporting
    different data governance and ownership requirements. The effort will transition
    and expand the grassroots Clowder user community into a distributed and organized
    open source community, governed by the stakeholders, providing a long term sustainable
    software resource supporting convergent research data needs.</p>

  title: CLS INFRA D1.1 Data Management Plan and Open Research Data Pilot (V1, M6)
  description: |-
    <p><strong>Project summary </strong></p>

    <p>The digital age offers challenges and opportunities for completing research on Europe&rsquo;s multilingual and interconnected literary heritage. Even though many resources are currently available in digital libraries, a lack of standardisation hinders their access and reuse. The EU funded CLS INFRA project will help build the shared and sustainable infrastructure needed to undertake literary studies in the digital age. The project will align these diverse resources with each other, with the tools needed to interrogate them, and with a widened base of users. The resulting improvements will benefit researchers by bridging gaps between greater and lesserresourced communities in computational literary studies and beyond, ultimately offering opportunities to create new research and insight into our shared and varied European cultural heritage.</p>

    <p><strong>Executive summary </strong></p>

    <p>This deliverable presents the first version of Data Management Plan for the Horizon 2020 project CLS INFRA. To maximise the potential of the present document as a living and functional project management tool, the team decided to accommodate to this present DMP all sorts of digital scholarly objects that qualify as data or software and that are deemed worthy to be captured and preserved for reuse. Following the Horizon 2020 Data Management Plan template and guidelines, the document first defines the scope and selection criteria for project outputs (1.1.) and provides a structured overview of data and software collected, created, and (re)used for and by the CLS INFRA project. The second, FAIR data chapter describes the provisions made or envisioned to accommodate the FAIR principles and thereby future usage of CLS INFRA data resources. The third chapter provides a similar FAIR assessment of software resources. The fourth chapter describes roles, responsibilities and practical commitments and safeguards that are in place for the successful implementation of the DMP. The fifth chapter covers data security aspects. In the final chapter, we accommodated discussions around ethical aspects such as safeguards for personal data handling and safeguards for adherence to intellectual property rights are discussed. While preparing the DMP, special attention has been given to domain and disciplinary specificities. The CLS INFRA Data Management Plan is a living document and shall be updated continuously throughout the project in line with the new information gathered via conducting the project activities</p>

  title: 'Open innovation in the manufacturing industry: A review and research agenda'
  description: <p>In today&#39;s competitive world, globalization touches all industries.
    The open innovation (OI) paradigm has garnered increasing importance in academic
    research and industrial applications. Considering this interest, this paper aims
    to synthetize up-to-date findings, outline the intellectual structure of OI within
    the manufacturing research domain, and suggest a future research agenda. Building
    upon the content analysis of 239 articles indexed in Web of Science and Scopus
    databases, using homogeneity analysis by means of alternating least squares (HOMALS),
    this study reveals the theoretical underpinnings, research trends, and methodologies
    of this research field. Our analysis revealed that the study of sustainability,
    commitment-based human resource practices, and Industry 4.0 (I40) represent important
    future research streams for OI in the manufacturing industry. In collaborating
    throughout the supply chain, manufacturing firms could minimize production waste,
    ensure better working conditions, and adapt business models. In the &ldquo;new
    normal&rdquo; posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, it is more important than ever to
    study the effects of managerial competencies, employee training and development,
    and reward systems on open cultures in manufacturing firms. This study goes on
    to outline research opportunities in I40, particularly regarding knowledge exchange
    and technology transfer among partners and OI&#39;s influence on the adoption
    of I40 technologies.</p>

  description: |-
    <p><strong>Embracing Open Science is critical if we are to make science more collaborative, reproducible, transparent and impactful. Open Science undoubtedly has the power to positively influence society, but its implementation is not yet universal.</strong></p>

    <p>A revolution is required: one which opens up research processes and changes mindsets in favour of a world where policies, tools and infrastructures universally support the growth and sharing of knowledge. Research libraries are well placed to make that revolution happen but first they must convince their own leaders and wider community of the value of Open Science.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>In this webinar, speakers from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.su.se/english/library"><strong>Stockholm University Library</strong></a>&nbsp;&mdash; Wilhelm Widmark (library director) and Sofie Wennstr&ouml;m (analyst) &mdash; described how they advocate&nbsp;for new ways of thinking and doing, and how they mobilised their community, in order to build a new future reality.&nbsp;</p>

  title: OPEN RESEARCH CHALLENGES IN HEALTH CARE INTERNET OF FORENSICS (H-IoF)
  description: <p>The human race has to acquaint with the up-to-date developments
    in order to be competent enough to regulate technology and to embrace the evolving
    healthcare technologies in order to stay pertinent in the imminent years. The
    health care data generated by the IoMT in the healthcare sector, poses many hurdles
    in managing them as they are of different types, voluminous, and are generated
    at high speed, making it difficult to store in local machines. IoMT is a sub branch
    of IoT and it deals with the medical devices and health care related crimes and
    it demands the examination of the relevant devices; besides the other research
    challenges like security, privacy etc., In order to settle the dispute among the
    parties legally, after the occurrence of a data breach event; a digital forensics
    mechanism has to be devised proactively in order to regulate and renovates the
    chain of events by examining the physical evidence and electronic data; apply
    analytical techniques to detect, excerpt, preserve, and analyze digital information;
    Post-Mortem investigation; case-centered; time-restricted process; Forensics Readiness;
    stipulate the judicial area and legal characteristics in service legal agreements
    concerning the forensics issues. This paper work presents a rationalized review
    of the Healthcare Internet of Things (H-IoT), rationale for the study of IoMT
    forensics, applications, various open research challenges in Healthcare Internet
    of Forensics (H-IoF). Healthcare Internet of Forensics or IoMT forensics, an umbrella
    term, encasing issues of IoMT and Digital Forensics, may support in investigating
    IoMT ecosystems and quickly respond to and report IoMT security incidents. This
    study provokes the necessity for Healthcare Internet of Forensics. Moreover, this
    study also reveals the need for immediate research that are capable enough to
    be rendered as solutions. Last but not the least, this paper provides an insight
    into the latest IoMT forensics research trends, which will prove beneficial in
    the development of Digital forensic investigation process.</p>

  title: Three perspectives on Open Science in research assessment
  description: |-
    <p>In our Accelerate Open Science Project (ACOS), one of our aims is to give context to various developments in the area of Open Science. One very important development in this respect is the discussion about changing the academic system of recognition and rewards to stimulate researchers to incorporate Open Science in their daily workflow. In the Netherlands, there are several developments to change existing research assessment protocols towards a more inclusive and generous approach that enables researchers to work more openly and transparent.</p>

    <p>Three perspectives are leading in this discussion, namely the perspective from a researcher, the research and the research proposals. ACOS prepared a slide deck to give an overview of these developments and highlight recommendations to facilitate change. On a personal, team, faculty and institutional level.</p>

  title: How the use of controlled, accepted vocabularies could be improved to achieve
    open-science outcomes.
  description: |-
    <p>Environmental science teams are characteristically multi-disciplinary, multi-national, and multi-organisational. The environmental and ecological challenges that face us make these characteristics&nbsp;unavoidable if the best open science is to be achieved. The importance of ensuring the terms that describe shared data, and indeed information, are well-understood and properly defined cannot be under-estimated, not just within the teams themselves, but also when sharing the results with the world.</p>

    <p>In a session run at SciDataCon in late 2021<sup>1</sup>, several data-science specialists were asked to talk about their experience of how scientists engage with earth and environmental vocabularies and ontologies. This session highlighted the question of whether scientists truly appreciate the reason for using standardised vocabularies, and whether there were ways to improve their acceptance and hence practice. This would require several approaches. One might be to demonstrate the effectiveness of using a community-recognised, controlled vocabulary in enabling work to be discovered. Another might be to get researchers to identify and engage with a CoreTrustSeal<sup>2</sup> accredited repository for their project data at the start of the project. Another is to create a range of educational packages, such as those introducing them to established vocabularies and ontologies. Overlay these challenges with language differences, we need to be more and more inventive. We must improve the situation for researchers and demonstrate to them that there is value in using standardised and accepted vocabularies and that this is an achievable part of their work, we miss fully benefitting from the wealth of expertise available to solve global problems and learn from each other.</p>

    <p>In this talk we shall expand on these options, showing where they might be most effectively introduced.</p>

  title: Best collaborative practices for advocacy and promotion of Open Educational
    Resources
  description: |-
    <p><em><strong>Purpose &ndash;</strong>&nbsp;</em><em>The present study, after reviewing the relevant literature and the recent trends that became evident from the Open Education Global Conference 2018 (and other similar fora), documents the best practices to be adopted by the Greek academic libraries, in order to support the OER actions in Higher Education by making the Academic Community aware of the culture of OER adoption/use.</em></p>

    <p><em>&nbsp;<strong>Design/methodology/approach&nbsp;</strong></em><em><strong>&ndash;</strong> It emerged from the analysis of the empirical results of a&nbsp;</em><em>relevant&nbsp;</em><em>research conducted among faculty of Greek Universities. The research inquired into the support/guidance that academic libraries offer to the faculty of their institutions for: a. adopting/using Open Educational Resources (OER), b. creating OER and c. OER intellectual property (copyright).</em></p>

    <p><em>&nbsp;<strong>Findings &ndash;</strong>&nbsp;</em><em>The results of the research showed that most of the faculty does not consider academic libraries much supportive of them in any of the three areas investigated -as opposed to what occurs in Europe and internationally.</em></p>

    <p><em>&nbsp;<strong>Originality/value &ndash; </strong>The practices documented could: a. gain advantage from the existing library infrastructure and enhance the know-how and digital competence of librarians in the following areas: OER location, intellectual property (copyright), metadata and quality assurance, institutional repositories (storage and preservation), b. support faculty and students in cultivating their digital skills and thus achieving &ldquo;OER Literacy&rdquo;.&nbsp;</em></p>

  title: Winning Horizon 2020 with Open Science
  description: |-
    <p><strong><em>WHY Open Science in Horizon 2020? </em></strong></p>

    <p>Open Science (OS) offers researchers tools and workflows for transparency, reproducibility, dissemination and transfer of new knowledge. Ultimately, this can also have an impact on in research evaluation exercises, e.g. Research Excellence Framework (REF), set to demand greater &ldquo;<em>societal impact</em>&rdquo; in future, rather than just research output[1]. OS can also be an effective tool for research managers to transfer knowledge to society, and optimize the use and re-use by unforeseen collaborators. For funders, OS offers a better return on investment (ROI) for public funding, and underpins the EU Digital Agenda by measurably contributing to economic growth. This brief showcases why and how Open Science can optimize your Horizon 2020 proposal evaluation.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong><em>WHO is this &ldquo;BRIEF&rdquo; for?</em></strong></p>

    <p>This brief is developed through EC funding and specifically aimed at Horizon 2020 applicants and proposal writers seeking to comply with the Horizon 2020 Mandate (<em>Grant Agreement article 29.1-6</em>) and to optimize proposal evaluation and eventual societal impact of the resulting project.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong><em>HOW to use the &ldquo;BRIEF&rdquo;?</em></strong></p>

    <p>The text is <strong>NOT</strong> intended to be used verbatim as copy and paste contribution to your proposal. Instead, the brief presents suggested ways of formulating an impact section that answers the overarching political agendas and initiatives, as well as tips for ensuring that research results are effectively delivered to any users and the market place, across the various Horizon 2020 Pillars. The main text is generic, but some discipline-specific examples are included as examples, rather than covering all research fields. The footnotes also point to additional resources that will facilitate implementation to optimize project visibility and impact.</p>

    <p><em><strong>Testing Brief impact on Evaluation Process: </strong></em><br />
    The brief was developed and tested with applicants of the funding calls below, and subsequently delivered through a series of training seminar series for Horizon 2020 National Contact Points (NCP) in Austia, Belgium, Denmark, Finland as part of FP7 FOSTER (Grant Agreement 612 425) Training Calendar.<br />

  title: Embracing a FAIR Culture. FAIRsFAIR Synchronisation efforts in aligning with
    EU initiatives to foster Open Science in Europe
  description: |-
    <p>A key challenge for FAIRsFAIR is to ensure project activities dovetail with work carried out by the EOSC Governance Working Groups, and feed into and complement work being done by other projects in the research data and FAIR space. FAIRsFAIR is looking in particular at four strategic assets:&nbsp;</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>DATA PRACTICES</strong></p>

    <p>In collaboration with established experts, FAIRsFAIR will document and further develop data practice and repository design to dramatically enhance data interoperability across scientific domains and geographic divides.<strong> </strong>A first set of Recommendations has already been released specifically on FAIR Semantics (D2.2 - <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3707985#.XrQTqKgzaM8">https://zenodo.org/record/3707985#.XrQTqKgzaM8</a>) and&nbsp; for Persistence and Interoperability (D2.1 - <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3557381#.XrQULKgzaM8">https://zenodo.org/record/3557381#.XrQULKgzaM8</a>) together with reports on FAIR Data Practice Analysis (D3.2 - <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3581353#.XrQUeagzaM8">https://zenodo.org/record/3581353#.XrQUeagzaM8</a>) and the Features of FAIR Data Repositories (D2.3 - <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3631528#.XrQU3qgzaM8">https://zenodo.org/record/3631528#.XrQU3qgzaM8</a>).</p>

    <p><strong>DATA POLICY</strong></p>

    <p>Based on a thorough review of the current policy landscape, FAIRsFAIR will make concrete recommendations to enhance FAIR policy and embed FAIR culture in institutes of higher learning. In this regard, a FAIR Policy Landscape Analysis report has been published (D3.1 - <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3558173#.XrQWB6gzaM8">https://zenodo.org/record/3558173#.XrQWB6gzaM8</a>), followed by Recommendations for Policy Enhancements (D3.3 - <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3686901#.XrQWWqgzaM8">https://zenodo.org/record/3686901#.XrQWWqgzaM8</a>). A report on <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3629683">FAIR in European Higher Education</a> (D7.1 - <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3629683#.XrQWvagzaM8">https://zenodo.org/record/3629683#.XrQWvagzaM8</a>) has also been released.</p>

    <p><strong>FAIR COMPETENCE CENTRE</strong></p>

    <p>FAIRsFAIR will establish an educational programme to equip researchers, trainers and institutes of higher learning across Europe with the information and skills required to produce and curate FAIR data. In this regard, an Overview of Needs for Competence Centres (D6.1 - <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3549791#.XrQXSqgzaM8">https://zenodo.org/record/3549791#.XrQXSqgzaM8</a>) and a preliminary definition of the FAIRsFAIR Core Competence Centre (D6.2 - <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3732889#.XrQXyqgzaM8">https://zenodo.org/record/3732889#.XrQXyqgzaM8</a>) have been published.</p>

    <p><strong>FAIR CERTIFICATION</strong></p>

    <p>FAIRsFAIR will establish a FAIR assessment tool and, by actively supporting selected repositories to achieve certification, create a European network of certified repositories. To this end, a Vision for the Components of a FAIR Ecosystem have been documented (<a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3565428#.XrQZMqgzaM8">https://zenodo.org/record/3565428#.XrQZMqgzaM8</a>) alongside Draft Recommendations on Requirements for FAIR Datasets in Certified Repositories (D4.1 <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3678716#.XrQZ26gzaM8">https://zenodo.org/record/3678716#.XrQZ26gzaM8</a>).</p>

    <p>For this reason the FAIRsFAIR project set up the<strong> Synchronisation Force</strong>, a team tasked with establishing a dialogue among the various projects and actors in both the EOSC and FAIR ecosystems whose work touches on FAIR. Its mandate is to maximise coordination and minimise unnecessary overlap or duplication, facilitate synergies between project activities, and EOSC governance, and promote collaboration mechanisms aimed at turning FAIR into reality.</p>

  title: Case studies on Open Science in the context of ERC projects - Set 4
  description: "<p>This document presents the fourth of five sets of case studies
    that have been produced in the framework of the <em>&lsquo;Study on open access
    to publications and research data management and sharing within ERC projects&rsquo;.
    </em>This study has been procured by the ERC Executive Agency under contract number
    ERCEA/A1/2016/06.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The following three case studies are included
    in this set:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Twelve Labours of Image Processing (Twelve Labours)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>A
    commitment of one research group at ENS Paris-Saclay to document their research
    process systematically and publish research outputs that are easily reproducible
    gave way to a new open access journal, &lsquo;Image Processing On Line&rsquo;.
    It is the first journal in the field openly hosting methods, codes and providing
    a possibility to conduct experiments and process images online. Created by Professor
    Jean-Michel Morel and his team during the <a href=\"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/94299_en.html\">Twelve
    Labours</a> project, the journal is gaining its place in the computer vision and
    image processing fields. So far, it has not only proved to be useful in assuring
    further funding for the research group but has also been used widely by academics
    from various disciplines as well as other practitioners, from both public and
    private sectors.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Predicting Environment-Specific Biotransformation
    of Chemical Contaminants (PROduCTS)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Although chemical contaminants
    can pose significant risks to the natural world, microbes can reduce such risk
    through biotransformation. The <a href=\"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/188652_en.html\">PROduCTS</a>
    project, led by Professor Kathrin Fenner at the Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic
    Science and Technology (Eawag), is investigating, measuring and aiming to predict
    the outcomes of the biotransformation process through which microbes break down
    contaminants into different, typically less harmful chemical structures. Her team
    has established enviPath, a free online tool, available openly to everyone, to
    document the sparsely scattered valuable data about chemical contaminants, their
    transformation pathways, kinetics and end products. This is the first open database
    for such data in the field of analytical and environmental chemistry, and it is
    proving to be a valuable resource for the scientific community, public authorities
    as well as industry.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Layered Functional Materials &ndash; Beyond
    &lsquo;Graphene&rsquo; (BEGMAT)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Michael Bojdys is an Associate
    Professor and Group Leader of the Functional Nanomaterials laboratory at Berlin&rsquo;s
    Humboldt University. As PI of the <a href=\"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/204703_en.html\">BEGMAT</a>
    project, in the highly competitive nanomaterials field, he has led his group in
    a gradual shift towards data management and sharing; at first internally and now
    increasingly publicly. Spurred by the ERC&rsquo;s support for open science and
    his experiences as a postdoc working in the UK, his lab benefits from project
    efficiency and quality control by taking a formalised approach to research data
    management.&nbsp; Institutional infrastructure has been a key enabler and, in
    turn, the lab&rsquo;s RDM processes make it easier to share data to aid the reproducibility
    of published articles, extending existing practices of sharing supplementary material.</p>"

  title: OpenAIRE input on UNESCO's open science consultation
  description: |-
    <p>The potential of open science is vast and profound and goes far beyond the sharing of the outputs of research. At its core, it promotes the concept of sharing research, building on cumulative results, largely based on the verification of previous results, thanks in the main to the plethora of digital technologies. This ultimately leads to a radical transformation of the culture of research. Open science has the ability to change the ways in which research is performed via its inputs and sources, in its collaborations and partnerships, in how, and how quickly, it is accessed and applied. It can embrace diverse and inclusive modes of communication, dialogue and engagement, in how research is validated and reviewed, and in new, richly-enhanced and deeply-interconnected types of outputs.</p>

    <p>The pursuit and application of knowledge in the service of the grand challenges facing humanity is a truly global endeavour. Science can only succeed in this context when it is openly shared and accessible by all. Science &lsquo;done right&rsquo;, through open science can transform society by opening up access to knowledge via the free flow of information. This, in turn, maximises the societal and economic impact of research for the global benefit of humanity and of the planet.</p>

    <p>Open science is, therefore, a fundamental foundation of the UN Sustainable Development Goals and constitutes a cross-cutting contribution to the achievement of those Goals. For this reason, OpenAIRE fully supports UNESCO&rsquo;s call to develop global open science principles and endorses UNESCO&rsquo;s efforts to promote and achieve open science.</p>

    resource, a portfolio of a research contributor&#39;s outputs and activities,

    become visible and more easily recognised. The Openness Profile is modelling how
    research evaluation in an open science context can be improved. Expected benefits
    are highlighted and requirements listed. Recommendations are provided to various
    stakeholders how to establish the Openness Profile as research evaluation routine.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Over
    80 individual stakeholders from 48 different organisations provided input to this
    report on research assessment and open scholarship. The work and writing were
    done by consultants Fiona Murphy and Phill Jones of MoreBrains Cooperative, together
    with the KE Open Scholarship Research Evaluation task &amp; finish group.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Background</strong></p>\n\n<p>As
    part of Knowledge Exchange&#39;s (KE) work on Open Scholarship, we are exploring
    the topic of Research(er) Evaluation, with the aim to identify and support recognition
    of contributions to Open Scholarship, academic and non-academic, that are essential
    to make Open Scholarship truly work. Our approach is to raise awareness on the
    lack of recognition in current evaluation practice and work towards a possible
    solution.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Openness Profile</strong></p>\n\n<p>The
    KE Research Evaluation task &amp; finish group worked to improve awareness, listing
    all academic and non-academic contributions that are essential to Open Scholarship
    and should be recognised when evaluating research. The group also works on the
    &#39;Openness Profile&#39;, a tool that is meant to allow evaluation of currently
    ignored contributions that are essential for Open Science.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>By
    demonstrating the immaturity of current research evaluation practice, and by developing
    the Openness Profile tool, KE supports researchers as well as non-researchers
    to get credit for all their contributions that make Open Science possible. Our
    ambition is that recognition of these essential activities becomes part of standard
    research evaluation routine.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>For the development of
    the Openness Profile, we have been exploring a concept that would recognise contributions
    to Open Science by documenting these as digital objects connected to a persistent
    identifier. We envisage the Openness Profile as a collection of documented contributions
    with a DOI , linked to the contributor&rsquo;s ORCID iD.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>There
    is a concern among the Open Science movement that there is a discrepancy between
    open science policy and the practices of current researchers. Also, there needs
    to be a system in place for rewarding research contributors for the Open Science
    activities they do but are invisible to contemporary research evaluation protocols.
    The Openness Profile would act as an incentivizing and rewarding tool, as well
    as a means of turning the OS into standard research evaluation routine.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Report
    &lsquo;Openness Profile: Modelling research evaluation for open scholarship&#39;</strong></p>\n\n<p>The
    new report describes mechanisms and approaches to improve and incentivize the
    recording, evaluation, and recognition of contributions to Open Scholarship practice,
    this report will be of interest to you. As a follow-up on the report &lsquo;Openness
    Profile: Defining the concepts&rsquo; (January 2020, DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.3607579),
    it presents how the Openness Profile can help address existing gaps in the assessment
    of open science.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The Openness Profile is a digital
    resource, a portfolio of a research contributor&#39;s outputs and activities,
    accessible in a single place. Academic and non-academic open scholarship activities
    become visible and more easily recognised. Relying on persistent identifiers to
    combine already existing information with additional (including narrative) testimony
    of achievements, the usage of the Openness Profile could become a standard reference
    model in open research evaluation routine.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Over 80
    individual stakeholders from 48 different organisations provided input to this
    report on research assessment and open scholarship. The work and writing were
    done by consultants Fiona Murphy and Phill Jones of MoreBrains Cooperative, together
    with the KE Task &amp; Finish group on Research Evaluation.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The
    work on the Openness Profile relates to issues such as:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>The
    need to accelerate the transition to open - operationalising and normalising open
    scholarship practices has proven challenging.</li>\n\t<li>Conflicting ambitions
    combined with strong network effects that punish those who deviate from sector
    norms around research assessment and practice.</li>\n\t<li>The economic nature
    of challenges, either financial or relating to actors&rsquo; incentives, associated
    with the transition to open scholarship.</li>\n\t<li>Distortion of researcher
    behaviour due to over-reliance on traditional metrics.</li>\n\t<li>Underfunded
    and underdeveloped funder grant information systems. Poor adoption of PIDs and
    little to no interoperability with downstream stakeholders.</li>\n\t<li>Key contributors
    to the academic knowledge ecosystem being under-recognised</li>\n\t<li>Research
    being organised with &lsquo;well defined&rsquo; rules that do not include &lsquo;open&rsquo;-related
    criteria.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The potential to improve open research evaluation
    practice as well as the requirements to implement the Openness Profile are addressed,
    including recommendations for stakeholders.</p>"

  title: Data Lab - An Open-Data, Open-Access Science Platform
  description: |-
    <p>Data Lab (https://datalab.noao.edu) is NOAO&#39;s science exploration<br>
    platform. It provides open access to large-scale survey data<br>
    (e.g. Dark Energy Survey, Legacy Surveys), images and spectra acquired<br>
    on NOAO facilities, and allows users to share and publish their own<br>
    data with collaborators or the wider community. Data Lab furnishes<br>
    users with compute resources, virtual storage (disk and database) and<br>
    interfaces to assist in data analysis, filtering, processing and<br>
    visualization. Additionally, access to local copies of high-value<br>
    reference data (e.g. Gaia, AllWISE, SDSS, etc) as well as external<br>
    data, provides an integrated environment that is a great resource for<br>
    anyone interested in large scale survey science, not least for<br>
    researchers seeking readiness for LSST now. I will introduce the Data<br>
    Lab ecosystem, its functionalities, and database holdings. In a<br>
    demo/tutorial following my talk, participants can try Data Lab for<br>
    themselves by working with their laptops through several specific<br>
    science examples ranging from extracting light curves of variable<br>
    objects, to the detection of Milky Way dwarf satellites, to separating<br>
    active galaxies from other sources. I will make the case for<br>
    open-data, open-compute environments in an era of big data abundance<br>
    on one hand, but also constrained and unequal resources on the other<br>
    hand. This will hopefully inspire participants to bring their own<br>
    big-data science questions to an integrated science platform such as<br>
    Data Lab.</p>

  title: D4.8 Report on possibilities for incorporating open source CAT tool functionality
    into the TMT
  description: |-
    <p>This report reviews potential mechanisms to integrate a Translation Memory (TM) solution into the Translation Management Tool (TMT), allowing large international surveys to improve their translation processes and deliver quicker and better quality translations. This will include further research into integration with other external CAT tools and the development of a stand-alone Translation Memory tool to which the TMT will be connected, followed by an evaluation and implementation of various TM matching algorithms and sharing of TMT data with partners via the TM solution.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>SSHOC project Task 4.3 applies computer assisted translation tools in social sciences. Since several large international social science survey projects use the Translation Management Tool (TMT) to support their translation processes, an extended review was done on how various open source CAT tools can be linked to the TMT. This report describes the possibilities of integrating open source CAT tools into the Translation Management tool.</p>

    <p>A functionality commonly utilized in CAT tool is Translation Memory (TM), which refers to a variety of methods of processing and storing translated text in the form of &lsquo;segments&rsquo; and representing them at a later time, when similar texts need to be translated. Such segments are text strings that are sentences or sentence-like strings, such as headers, labels, etc. Segments are connected in source-translation pairs, where the source is the original text and translation is the translated version of this text in a certain language. By storing many of such pairs a repository of historical translation data is created which can be used to aid translation processes.</p>

    <p>However, given the highly specialized set of translations and processes, integrating these external CAT toolsand underlying TMs into TMT is not enough. The development and integration of a new open source TM solution, tailored to the field, seems a better approach for integration into the TMT translation environment. Based on this the team has defined the following steps:</p>

    <p><strong>Evaluation of possible integration of external CAT tools in the TMT;</strong> the team started to explore further possibilities to integrate external open-source CAT tools in the TMT will be explored with the connection achieved between the TMT and the LINDAT translation service and MyMemory developed under SSHOC deliverable 4.7 Code for data exchange between TMT and open-source CAT software serving as a guideline.</p>

    <p><strong>Development of a Translation Memory (TM) solution;</strong> initial creation of a stand-alone TM solution that will allow users to query it for translation suggestions based on input text and source and target translations as well as allow external Computer Aided Translation (CAT) tools to query it for translation suggestions and add new data via an API.</p>

    <p><strong>Connecting the TMT to the new TM solution and (possible) other CAT tools</strong>; extending already existing translation functionality within the <strong>Translation Management Tool</strong> (TMT) tool to work together with the newly created TM solution via its API and possible other CAT tools with the aim of providing translation memories to translators.</p>

    <p><strong>Research into pair matching and search methods; </strong>The team set up criteria to evaluate methods and algorithms for pair matching and search, including implementation and testing of several such methods, which will then be made available in the TM solution.</p>

    <p><strong>The sharing of TMT data with partners;</strong> using the developed TM solution and the TMT connection to export TMT data for sharing with survey partners.</p>

  title: How I failed to do Open Notebook Cheminformatics
  description: <p>I always believed that with Open Data, Open Source, and Open Standards
    I was doing the right thing; that it was enough for a better science. However,
    I have come to the realization that these features are not enough. Surely, they
    aid Open collaborations, though not even sufficient there, but they fail horribly
    in the &quot;scientific method.&quot; Because while ODOSOS makes work reproducible,
    it lacks the context needed by scholars to understand what it solved. That is,
    it details out in much detail how some scientific question is answered, but not
    what question that was. As such, it fails to follow the established practices
    in scholarly research. In this presentation I will show how I should have done
    some of my research, and ponder on reasons why I had not done so.</p>

  title: 'Enabling Open Science: Wikidata for Research'
  description: <p>Wiki4R will create an innovative virtual research environment (VRE)
    for Open Science at scale, engaging both professional researchers and citizen
    data scientists in new and potentially transformative forms of collaboration.
    It is based on the realizations that (1) the structured parts of the Web itself
    can be regarded as a VRE, (2) such environments depend on communities, (3) closed
    environments are limited in their capacity to nurture thriving communities. Wiki4R
    will therefore integrate Wikidata, the multilingual semantic backbone behind Wikipedia,
    into existing research processes to enable transdisciplinary research and reduce
    fragmentation of research in and outside Europe. By establishing a central shared
    information node, research data can be linked and annotated into knowledge. Despite
    occasional uses of Wikipedia or Wikidata in research, significant barriers to
    broader adoption in the sciences or digital humanities exist, including lack of
    integration into existing research processes and inadequate handling of provenances.
    The proposed actions include providing best practices and tools for semantic mapping,
    adoption of citation and author identifiers, interoperability layers for integration
    with existing research environments, and the development of policies for information
    quality and interchange. The effectiveness of the actions will be tested in pilot
    use cases. Unforeseen barriers will be investigated and documented. We will promote
    the adoption of Wiki4R by making it easy to use and integrate, demonstrate the
    applicability in selected research domains, and provide diverse training opportunities.
    Wiki4R leverages the expertise gained in Europe through the Wikidata and DBpedia
    projects to further strengthen the established virtual community of 14000 people.
    As a result of increased interaction between professional science and citizens,
    it will provide an improved basis for Responsible Research and Innovation and
    Open Science in the European Research Area.</p>

  title: 'CEUR-WS.org: Open-Access as a Community Effort'
  description: |-
    <p>Conventional wisdom says that open-access (OA) publishing is not sustainable without a proper financial basis. Commercial OA publishers charge authors, their employers, or their roof organizations considerable fees to cover the costs and to generate income for the OA publishers. This may lead to undesired effects such as giving preference to authors who can afford the fee over those who do not have the resources.<br>
    CEUR-WS.org (CEUR Workshop Proceedings) selected a different path in 1995 when it was founded as a service operated under the umbrella of Sun SITE Central Europe ar RWTH Aachen University. We deliberately focussed on computer science workshop proceedings, which had difficulties to find publishers at that time. More importantly, we designed the service with a team of volunteer scientists who perform the publication service in their free time and without charging any fee from authors, editors, or readers.<br>
    Now, after more than 20 years, the service is still operating and growing every year. In the last year, we published more than 250 proceedings volumes, making CEUR-WS.org one of the largest open-access publication channels for computer science proceedings.<br>
    In this talk, we discuss the success factors of CEUR-WS.org and some of the challenges that we encountered over the past two decades. We also give some glimpses into future extensions of the service such as open data, semantification, and improved interoperability with neighbor services such as DBLP and the indexing by national libraries.<br>
    We believe that scientists should take a greater role in the publication value chain. We know best our needs for future publication models, the ethical conditions for fairness, and the rules governing scientific publication.<br>
    Many thanks go to the team of Sun SITE Central Europe for hosting the service and the members of the CEUR-WS.org Team who run the service for free, for you.</p>

  title: 'Towards a shared vision for open scholarly communication: the Vienna Principles
    and the Jussieu Call'
  description: <p>There are considerable deficits in how scholarly knowledge is produced
    and disseminated. Open Science has the potential to change the workings of the
    scholarly communication system for the better. Openness, however, is a means to
    an end and within the scientific community, there is no commonly agreed set of
    principles that describe the system of scholarly communication that we want to
    create. Open Science is still a fuzzy concept for many; grounding it in a set
    of widely shared principles would make it much more understandable. The Vienna
    Principles and the Jussieu Call are two efforts into this direction. In my talk,
    I will point out commonalities and differences between the two charta and sketch
    how they can further a shared vision for open scholarly communication in collaboration
    with other initiatives.</p>

  title: 'Extending the Open Access using Extensions: Freeing Scholarly Communication
    from the Walled Garden'
  description: <p>IFLA/FAIFE strongly advocates intellectual freedom as the basis
    of democracy and the core of the library concept. The spirit and philosophy of
    Open Access are in sync with FAIFE owing to its visible role in sharing intellectual
    freedom for building information democracy. The present paper is dedicated to
    the new and emerging technology-driven tools for researchers and academicians
    to access or discover OA research more easily and effectively. The main focus
    of the paper is to introduce to the readers about the various technology-driven
    tools for effective and immediate Open Access (OA) research discovery. Under this
    objective, mission and services of the OA discovery system CORE has been explained.
    Another powerful tool for OA discovery and dissemination is OA Button which comes
    with the collaboration of unique service tools like, InstantILL, DeliverOA, EmbedOA,
    OAsheet and shareyourpaper. In addition to the above two tools, this study further
    discusses two more stand-alone tools namely, Dataverse and Zenodo. These tools
    are mainly familiar with their data archiving policies. Testing the features of
    these tools and describing their utility and application reveal that they can
    help the users as well as libraries in making effective use of OA resources without
    any delay while also enhancing the visibility of such scholarly resources.</p>

    <p>As open access publishing options and mandates expand, how does this &lsquo;openness&rsquo; extend to other sources of research and knowledge such as academic libraries?

Analysis of library access or use policies and related documents from twenty academic institutions in Asia, Australia, Europe, Latin America, North America, South Africa and the United Kingdom shows that access to libraries for the unaffiliated public is often the most restricted. Many libraries impose financial and sometimes security barriers on physical entry to buildings and this limits access to the collections still in print and other non-digital formats. This has occurred over several decades as a result of factors such as budgetary restraints and increased demand. Yet increasingly academic institutions are providing open access to digital research output through institutional repositories and open access publishing policies. We contrasted library access policies and practices with those of open access publication and research sharing for the same institutions and found limited correlation between both sets of policies. This suggests the intentions expressed by the two policy actions have not been applied in similar directions, in other words to reach the same ends. Comparing the two assessments using Spearman&rsquo;s rank correlation confirmed open access policies have a direct association with the narrow aspects of public access provided through online availability of formal publications, but are not necessarily associated (in the universities in this study) with delivering on a broader commitment to public access to knowledge.</p>

    <p>In this presentation, we discuss the process and the outcomes of this research. The results suggest that while institutional mission statements and academic library policies may refer to sharing of knowledge and research and community collaboration, multiple layers of library user categories, levels of privilege and fees charged can inhibit such access. This indicates disparities in openness between institutional library access policies and open access policies. As open access publishing options and mandates expand, physical entry to academic libraries and access to print and electronic resources is contracting. This varies within and across countries, but it can conflict with global library and information commitments to open access to knowledge. The study is continuing on a larger scale as part of an Open Knowledge Institutions project.</p>

  title: Training Entrepreneurial Competences with Open Innovation Paradigm in Higher
    Education
  description: |-
    <p>This paper shows the e ects of training entrepreneurial competences on employability</p>

    <p>in higher education. It identifies teaching methods that are more e ective in order to improve</p>

    <p>entrepreneurial competences. These are hackathon, team building, role play, and practical cases</p>

    <p>with entrepreneurs at a Spanish university. In contrast to the methods shown in previous literature,</p>

    <p>a mixed-method is proposed. Firstly, a qualitative technique based on three focus groups with</p>

    <p>the participation of lecturers, students, and entrepreneurs are used. Additionally, a regression</p>

    <p>analysis seeks links between entrepreneurial intention and employability with entrepreneurial</p>

    <p>competences with 329 students. The findings show the direct e ect on skills appreciated in companies,</p>

    <p>using collaborative and practical activities focusing on competency perspective. This research work</p>

    <p>provides a new approach to training entrepreneurial competences that demonstrates the main role of</p>

    <p>Open Innovation enhancing the main stakeholders&rsquo; motivation and improving their skills. Useful</p>

    <p>information is provided to design the academic syllabuses and improve the level of employability of</p>

    <p>university graduates.</p>

  title: 'Open Science for sustainability and inclusiveness: the SKA role model'
  description: |-
    <p>Open Science may seem like a &ldquo;new&quot; approach to Science, but in fact it is&nbsp;a fundamental principle of the Scientific Method, which was established in the 17th Century. &nbsp;The ability of Open Science to enhance&nbsp;scientific collaboration and knowledge&nbsp;interchange in a transparent way has put it in the spotlight in this era of&nbsp;Big Data and data intensive research. However, Open Science is not only an indispensable element of high-quality science and comes with a wider impact in other areas.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>In this talk we show how Open Science encourages the democratisation of science, accelerates the transfer of knowledge to society,&nbsp;promotes equity and&nbsp;inclusiveness as well as other actions that contribute to&nbsp;achieving&nbsp;the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations. Furthermore, we emphasise how it is key in maximising&nbsp;the scientific impact of the SKA Observatory: the SKA is a Big data infrastructure with a multidisciplinary worldwide community of users that already started collaborating to prepare for the challenge, whose core will be at the SKA Regional Centres, where SKA science will be carried out.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>We&nbsp;will&nbsp;also describe the existing barriers to&nbsp;embrace&nbsp;Open Science and the FAIR principles as seen from individual scientists, data centres, KSP teams, publishers or even funding agencies, and how the community building the SRCs is&nbsp;addressing&nbsp;these challenges. The effort seems worth it, both for better science and to maximise social impact. We argue that for the SKA, adoption of Open Science is both a need and a duty, and will show that the SKA and its community has already taken this flag.&nbsp;</p>

  title: Impact of the Open Educational Practices through Academic Achievement with
    Emotional, Social and Academic Adjustment among Researchers
  description: '<p>Purpose: The study&#39;s main objective was to determine the impact
    of the open educational practices through academic achievement with emotional,
    social, and intellectual adjustment among the state universities of Tamil Nadu
    researchers. Design/methodology/approach: The investigator has adopted the survey
    method of research to study the open educational resources with emotional, social,
    and academic adjustment of research scholars in Tamil Nadu&#39;s state universities.
    The selection of sampling technique used a stratified random sampling technique
    for selecting the samples. Most simply, the research design is a plan structure
    and investigation strategy to obtain an answer to the research questionnaire.
    Findings: Implementing the above practical suggestions offered to the undergraduate
    students and professors could well weed out inadequate emotional, social and educational
    adjustment, protect the good, help themselves in the open educational resources"
    learning process. To conclude, good and humanism adjustments among undergraduate
    student teachers in available educational resources will provide a good study
    atmosphere to help reach the academic vision. Originality: The present study seeks
    to measure the open educational, academic adjustment among Tamil Nadu researchers&#39;
    state universities. Practical/Social implications: Adjustments are actions or
    modifications made to enable researchers to access open educational resources
    and outcomes. Adjustments to teaching and learning through available educational
    resources mainly included emotional adjustment, social adjustment, and academic
    adjustment in the present study.</p>'

    and promotion of Open Access in their institution, which include an in-house publication
    fund, the development of Green Open Access infrastructures, and the handling of
    OA publications in the acquisition process. As a smaller institution themselves,
    they will also pose the question of how big the gap is in the implementation of
    Open Access between large and small libraries. They will then identify possibilities
    to narrow the gap and, in the best case, create structures that will help smaller
    libraries to promote Open Access and Open Science in their institutions.</p>"

  title: '[18] Developing research data services for an emerging open science culture
    that lacks national policies and guidelines'
  description: |-
    <p><strong>Abstract:&nbsp;</strong>In contrast to many European countries, Sweden lacks a national open science policy, presently having no national guidelines for researchers, research infrastructures, and other actors on how to manage research data to make research data FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable).</p>

    <p>Even though there is no national policy, there is a strong movement in the professional development of research data management (RDM) competencies and skills at Swedish universities; university libraries playing an important role. Researchers are increasingly requesting support for RDM, partially due to the new Horizon 2020 requirement of data management plans. We also see a growing interest for making research data FAIR from researchers across disciplines. In this poster presentation, we describe our approach to developing research data services at Lund University Library. Our work is based on the premises that there are no national, nor university specific, policies or guidelines, whereas the needs for RDM support are growing, and will continue to grow as the open science movement evolves.</p>

    <p>Lund University is a broad university with eight faculties, each having its own faculty libraries. The library services are thus decentralized and are highly specialised towards their users. This local &ldquo;closeness&rdquo; could be of high value in the future, when researchers will need support on research data services. Lund University Library provides services for the entire University, and has worked with research data management since 2014. We started out by identifying the characteristics and requirements of research data produced or collected by researchers at the University, thus tailoring the research data services to Lund University&rsquo;s research data. So far, we have conducted four studies: a study of the requirements for RDM within the humanities and social sciences; a survey of the current RDM practices at the University&rsquo;s Faculties; an explorative study of individual researchers&rsquo; RDM practices; and a study investigating researchers&rsquo; needs of support for data management plans. Currently, we offer services including advice on trusted data repositories, metadata quality, and provenance, e.g. persistent identifiers for data. We also follow the RDM area closely, participating in a network of actors and professionals in the RDM field. Since 2014, we contribute to the development of the ICOS Carbon Portal, a research infrastructure on greenhouse gas.</p>

    <p>The services we offer have been developed from the bottom-up, from researchers&rsquo; requests. However, we see a shift in the interest for RDM on several levels. The University&rsquo;s Research Board has set up a working group on research data, which is currently drafting a research data policy as part of an open science policy. With the growing interest from the University management, and national bottom-up initiatives of collaboration across universities, we anticipate contributing to the development of a University wide research data service organisation, which could be a network-based organization with nodes of different experts and professionals. We believe that librarians are well suited to coordinate such a network-based support organisation.</p>

    <p><strong>Bio:&nbsp;</strong>Maria Johnsson is a librarian specializing in research support services in the Section of Scholarly Communication at Lund University Library. She has a special focus on research data management and e-science, and on how libraries may develop services within research data management. Before joining the University Library, she had a position at the Library of Faculty of Engineering, Lund University. She also has experience in working with library and information services at different companies. She has a Master&rsquo;s in Library and Information Science, combined with studies in Modern Languages.</p>

  title: 'Three Challenges in Developing Open Multilingual DH Educational Resources:
    The Case of The Programming Historian'
  description: |-
    <p>What are the necessary conditions for developing multilingual open DH educational resources? Drawing on the English, Spanish and French-speaking editions of The Programming Historian, the aim of this lightning talk is to discuss three challenges encountered while implementing linguistic and cultural inclusivity and access.</p>

    <p>The first challenge concerns the internationalization of the Editorial Board and our lessons. In 2016, a Spanish-language team was recruited in order to translate tutorials under the title The Programming Historian en espa&ntilde;ol. In 2018, the Board recruited a French-language sub-team and in April 2019 it launched The Programming Historian en fran&ccedil;ais. The Board also published a set of &ldquo;Guidelines for writing for a global audience&rdquo;: authors are encouraged to write tutorials that are as much accessible as possible, having in mind cultural differences.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>The second challenge is the translation process. The act of translating requires extensive teamwork and coordination across our editorial team. Our translations are adapted to the target audience and they usually contain new instructions that cover the necessary steps to process texts and data in Spanish or French. In addition, these new full-language initiatives have challenged our infrastructure as an Open Access scholarly publication. As we are committed to publishing openly reviewed tutorials to a high standard, there is an extensive set of technical, editorial and administrative processes and policies in place.</p>

    <p>The third challenge is the production of original lessons in Spanish and French. After translating more than 40 tutorials from English to Spanish, in April 2019, The Programming Historian en espa&ntilde;ol has just released its first two original tutorials in Spanish. The design of a strategy to promote lessons that address research questions relevant for the Hispanic and Francophone communities seems a priority in the near future. Lessons that use alternative methods could contribute to increase the diversity of DH, especially if translated into English.</p>

    the first talk, Laetitia Bracco presents a steering tool to monitor the progress
    of Open Science within the scientific production of the University of Lorraine.
    Because the code used to develop this tool is freely accessible and reusable,
    and was designed in such a way as to allow simple and customizable reuse, any
    research institution can draw inspiration from it to build its own Monitor. This
    presentation will discuss the main conclusions of this work as well as the perspective
    considered for future development of the Monitor, which has already been used
    as a model by four other universities to publish their own.<br>\nThe second presentation,
    by Massimo K&ouml;ster, analyses the reluctance to publish in Open Access journals
    from the psychological perspective of individual researchers. He applies the goal-directed
    framework designed by K&ouml;ster&rsquo;s co-author to shed light on this type
    of behavioural reluctance and to organise and suggest possible interventions.
    They also list various factors that might contribute to behavioural reluctance
    in general and in the case of Open Access publishing, offering explanations for
    the reluctance to publish in OA journals. The discussion of each factor is followed
    by suggestions of potential intervention strategies to address the resulting reluctance.<br>\nFinally,
    Fr&eacute;d&eacute;rique Belliard and Nicoleta Nastase discuss a new collaborative
    Open Access journal called The Evolving Scholar (ThES). Developed by TU Delft
    OPEN Publishing and Orvium (a CERN start-up), the mission of ThES orbits around
    researchers and their research outputs. Every research finding &ndash; negative
    or positive &ndash; deserves to be shared for the benefit of the scientific community
    and the general public; and every researcher matters regardless of the stage they
    are at in their career. One of the goals of ThES is to give more visibility and
    recognition to the non-classical form of publications and their authors. This
    interactive session intends to show the ThES workflow: submit, review, and publish
    in short-lived online collaboration.</p>"

  title: 'The Turing Way: Engaging Community in Sharing Open and Reproducible Research
    Practices'
  description: |-
    <p><em>The Turing Way</em>&nbsp;is a handbook to reproducible, ethical and collaborative data science and research. We involve and support a diverse community of contributors to make data science accessible, comprehensible and effective for everyone. Our goal is to provide all the information that researchers and data scientists in academia, industry and the public sector need at the start of their projects to ensure that they are easy to reproduce at the end. In this talk, I will introduce the project and discuss the importance of meaningful engagement with the open science community for creating culture change in research.</p>

  title: Improved Virtual Research Environment using a Massive Open Online Research
    (MOOR) Platform
  description: <p>Cloud computing is a trend phenomenon in the online education world.
    It might advance learning and teaching techniques and methods with a creative
    collaborative virtual environment. It is a state of art internet technology that
    offers the user the availability of resources and services in a non spatio-temporal
    dependency which provides an access to large storage space and wide selection
    of services (Social Media, Email, Web Apps, Office suite&hellip;). Cloud computing
    has a prodigious potential for creating large accessible, flexible and interoperable
    networked environment that grants remarkable added value features to the Electronic
    Education (E-ducation). The Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) is a semi-autonomous
    networked learning environment, distributed on the cloud, in which open resources
    were produced and shared by participants worldwide. This technology was the latest
    innovation in the last few years. Different platforms were developed by several
    non-profit providers (edX, Coursera, Udacity, etc...) and supported by the world&rsquo;s
    most prestigious universities and institution such as MIT, Stanford, Harvard,
    etc&hellip;Those platforms are used by millions of students around the globe.
    This successful innovation so far has helped the development of E-ducation. This
    notion yields us to start thinking of extending this innovation approach to improve
    research in E-ducation. This could be an online platform for research which in
    return could push the development of online research worldwide and increase the
    collaboration between universities and institutions. The platform, defined as
    a Massive Open Online Research (MOOR), consists of a rich online open environment
    for research with unlimited user participation.</p>

  title: Open communities and promoting a culture of collaboration
  description: |-
    <p>Online behaviour over the last months during the COVID-19 pandemic has shifted significantly. With the echoing words like &ldquo;flatten the curve&rdquo; and &ldquo;stay home, save lives&rdquo;, we have become more inclined to stay informed about what exactly is going on in our communities. Over the last 30 days alone (in March 2020), 100s of online hackathon events have been launched to promote the development of software that can take on challenges related to coronavirus pandemic. There has been no better time for online platforms and communities to thrive and test innovative ideas for a common social cause. This is a very empowering time for individuals who want to lead a project and a particularly great time for Open Research. It is, unfortunately, also a time when more people will face barriers to open research communities such as isolation, and exclusion, if not done right. In this talk, I discuss that the community culture, when not intentionally developed by the community organizers and leaders, can create massive barriers in Open Research and its community by making them inaccessible to new and often diverse members.</p>

    <p>I discuss The Turing Way as an example of a community that is built upon a culture of collaboration and intentionally designed to be open and inclusive. The Turing Way is an open source book project that involves and supports a diverse research community in ensuring that reproducible and ethical data science is accessible and comprehensible for everyone. One of the main aims of this project is to lower the barrier to participation in an Open Research by defining community participation guidelines and the various pathways for contribution. The Turing Way is openly developed and all contributions, questions, comments, and recommendations are facilitated via our GitHub repository:&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way">https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way</a>.</p>

    <p>As the project is gradually expanding from a small team to a large community of collaborators, the scope of The Turing Way is also expanding to include different aspects of reproducibility, project design, collaboration, communication, and ethics. We invite researchers with experience of leading or participating in research communities to contribute to The Turing Way by transferring their skills and best practices into its chapter. As we continue to work from home and collaborate remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic, we specifically invite contributions to our remote collaboration chapters that will be beneficial for the wider research community.</p>

  title: DINA—Development of open source and open services for natural history collections
    & research
  description: '<p>The DINA Consortium (DINA = "DIgital information system for NAtural
    history data",  https://dina-project.net) is a framework for like-minded practitioners
    of natural history collections to collaborate on the development of distributed,
    open source software that empowers and sustains collections management. Target
    collections include zoology, botany, mycology, geology, paleontology, and living
    collections. The DINA software will also permit the compilation of biodiversity
    inventories and will robustly support both observation and molecular data.</p><p>The
    DINA Consortium focuses on an open source software philosophy and on community-driven
    open development. Contributors share their development resources and expertise
    for the benefit of all participants. The DINA System is explicitly designed as
    a loosely coupled set of web-enabled modules. At its core, this modular ecosystem
    includes strict guidelines for the structure of Web application programming interfaces
    (APIs), which guarantees the interoperability of all components (https://github.com/DINA-Web).
    Important to the DINA philosophy is that users (e.g., collection managers, curators)
    be actively engaged in an agile development process. This ensures that the product
    is pleasing for everyday use, includes efficient yet flexible workflows, and implements
    best practices in specimen data capture and management.</p><p>There are three
    options for developing a DINA module:</p>create a new module compliant with the
    specifications (Fig. 1),modify an existing code-base to attain compliance (Fig.
    2), orwrap a compliant API around existing code that cannot be or may not be modified
    (e.g., infeasible, dependencies on other systems, closed code) (Fig. 3).<p>All
    three of these scenarios have been applied in the modules recently developed:
    a module for molecular data (SeqDB), modules for multimedia, documents and agents
    data and a service module for printing labels and reports:</p><p>The <em>SeqDB
    collection management and molecular tracking system</em> (Bilkhu et al. 2017)
    has evolved through two of these scenarios. Originally, the required architectural
    changes were going to be added into the codebase, but after some time, the development
    team recognised that the technical debt inherent in the project wasn''t worth
    the effort of modification and refactoring. Instead a new codebase was created
    bringing forward the best parts of the system oriented around the molecular data
    model for Sanger Sequencing and Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) workflows.</p><p>In
    the case of the <em>Multimedia and Document Store</em> module and the <em>Agents</em>
    module, a brand new codebase was established whose technology choices were aligned
    with the DINA vision. These two modules have been created from fundamental use
    cases for collection management and digitization workflows and will continue to
    evolve as more modules come online and broaden their scope.</p><p>The <em>DINA
    Labels &amp; Reporting </em>module is a generic service for transforming data
    in arbitrary printable layouts based on customizable templates. In order to use
    the module in combination with data managed in collection management software
    Specify (http://specifysoftware.org) for printing labels of collection objects,
    we wrapped the <em>Specify 7</em> API with a DINA-compliant API layer called the
    "<em>DINA Specify Broker</em>". This allows for using the easy-to-use web-based
    template engine within the DINA <em>Labels &amp; Reports</em> module without changing
    Specify''s codebase.</p><p>In our presentation we will explain the DINA development
    philosophy and will outline benefits for different stakeholders who directly or
    indirectly use collections data and related research data in their daily workflows.
    We will also highlight opportunities for joining the DINA Consortium and how to
    best engage with members of DINA who share their expertise in natural science,
    biodiversity informatics and geoinformatics.</p>'

  title: The Global Open Science Cloud Landscape
  description: |-
    <p>We are at the threshold of an era with unprecedented opportunities for cross-disciplinary and cross-border research collaborations. Open Science that started years ago and is growing in momentum with the digitalization and many big investments such as those made by the European Commission. Open Science Cloud, Platform, Commons are developed at national and regional level.<strong> It is very timely for developing Global Open Science Cloud (GOSC) that aims to connect the different international, national and regional research infrastructures to create a global digital environment for borderless research and innovation. Fundamentally, it aims to make it easy for scientists to access cross-continent digital resources in order to resolve global challenges such as problems caused by the COVID19, and those identified in the UN sustainable Development Goals.</strong></p>

    <p>This report discusses the concept and landscape of GOSC. It is a major outcome from a workshop during EGI Conference 2020 that gathered global digital infrastructures, scientific communities, policy makers and funders to review the existing work, examine the available resources, and identify collaboration opportunities. This report is among the initial publications that document GOSC discussions with the aim to inform future developments.</p>

  title: The Dialectic between Effectiveness and Humanity in the Era of Open Knowledge
    from the Perspective of Pedagogy
  description: 'Teaching and learning should involve social issues by which effectiveness
    and humanity is due consideration as a guideline for sharing and co-creating knowledge.
    A qualitative method was used after a pioneer study to confirm pre-service teachers''
    awareness of open knowledge. There are 17 in-service teacher candidates sampling
    from 181 schools in Taiwan. Two questions are to resolve: a) How did teachers
    change their educational ideas, in particular, their attitudes to meet the needs
    of knowledge sharing and co-creativity; and b) How did they acknowledge the necessity
    of working out an appropriate way between the educational efficiency and the nature
    of education for high performance management. This interview investigated teachers''
    attitude of sharing and co-creating knowledge. The results show two facts in Taiwan:
    A) Individuals who must be able to express themselves will be capable of taking
    part in an open learning environment; and B) Teachers must lead the direction
    to inspire high performance and improve students'' capacity via knowledge sharing
    and co-creating knowledge, according to the student-centered philosophy. Collected
    data from interviewing showed that the teachers were well aware of changing their
    teaching methods and make some improvements to balance the educational efficiency
    and the nature of education. Almost all teachers acknowledge that ICT is helpful
    to motivate learning enthusiasm. Further, teaching integrated with ICT saves teachers''
    time and energy on teaching preparation and promoting effectiveness. Teachers
    are willing to co-create knowledge with students, though using information is
    not easy due to the lack of operating skills of the website and ICT. Some teachers
    are against to co-create knowledge in the informational background since they
    hold that is not feasible for there being a knowledge gap between teachers and
    students. Technology would easily mislead teachers and students to the goal of
    instrumental rationality, which makes pedagogy dysfunctional and inhumane; however,
    any high quality of teaching should take a dialectical balance between effectiveness
    and humanity.'

  title: 'D 5.4: YUFE Open Science calendar 2022'
  description: |-
    <p><em><strong>Background of the project</strong></em></p>

    <p>As part of the European Research Area vision, the European Commission is aiming to see the necessary transformations in R&amp;I that will include the promotion of citizen science and societal engagement, the mainstreaming of Open Science practices, the fostering of brain and knowledge circulation, strengthening of academia-business collaboration and embodiment in a global Research and Innovation (R&amp;I) ecosystem. The YUFE (Young Universities for the Future of Europe) alliance embraces &ldquo;YUFE Transforming Research and Innovation through Europe-wide Knowledge Transfer&rdquo; (YUFERING) this challenge by effectively contributing to pilot these needed transformations to improve and harmonise the conditions for R&amp;I in Europe. Focusing on key elements of the ERA and in full alignment with the relevant SwafS call for proposals, YUFERING proposes ground-breaking transformation actions that will bring the partners one step closer to creating and realising a shared robust R&amp;I vision.</p>

    <p><em><strong>Deliverable content</strong></em></p>

    <p>More specifically, WP5 aims to create a YUFE Open Science Strategy and look for a post-COVID-19 approach that states Open Science as &ldquo;the new normal&rdquo; in YUFE Universities. In this regard, one of the main objectives is the &lsquo;Engagement/Education/Training: Co-creation of a YUFE Open Education Training Suite on Open Science&rsquo;. In this scheme, Task 5.4. aims to co-create a training and training and engaging scheme for YUFE researchers about Open Science and, one of the subtasks, is the elaboration of an Open Science Calendar that aims to increase awareness on the open science practices among the researchers (and some intended staff --OS Units, Libraries, Research Support--) from the YUFERING Universities. This deliverable presents this output, from its conceptualization until launch by each one of the partners. The calendar created was a co-joint effort with all the partners and was further customized by each institution, having adopted different dissemination strategies that are detailed in this report.</p>

    is to notice that most of the issues discussed in this document can also apply
    for developing policies in the framework of the most general strategy now identified
    as Open Science (OS), which according to the EC represents a new approach to the
    scientific process based on cooperative work and new ways of diffusing knowledge
    by using digital technologies and new collaborative tools. Such a strategy, focusing
    on the whole research process, in the current formulation by the EC also embraces
    aspects related to other keys of RRI, i.e., citizen engagement, science education
    and research ethics and&nbsp;integrity, respectively making the object of Guidance
    documents # 2, 3, and 4, which will be thus not included here.</p>"

  title: Introducing a Course on Open Educational Resources (OER) during COVID-19
    to Empower Women Learners with Visual Impairment in Pakistan- Perceptions, Practices,
    and Potentials
  description: <p>This paper reflects on the potential of introducing an OER course
    to empower visually impaired female learners in Karachi, Pakistan, during COVID-19.
    Through a participatory action research approach, twenty female learners completed
    an adapted course titled &lsquo;Understanding Open Educational Resources&rsquo;,
    offered by the Commonwealth of Learning. For a hands-on experience, they later
    participated in various collaborative activities. Data was gathered through audio
    surveys, focus groups, and interviews, and analyzed thematically. Overall, the
    course empowered participants and shifted their dependencies to independencies.
    Participants were engaged in communities of practices, and took ownership to search,
    filter, and create/adapt open learning resources. The course has opened up new
    avenues for them to benefit their community members in innovative ways. It is
    proposed to introduce OER in national education policy to ensure educational accessibility
    among the disadvantaged population.</p>

  title: Open Up the Open Access Conversation at a STEM-focused University
  description: |-
    <p>This is a presentation delivered at the&nbsp;<em>253rd ACS National Meeting &amp; Exposition</em>, San Francisco, CA, April <strong>2017 </strong>during the Open Access: Current Landscape, Challenges &amp; Future Directions Symposium hosted by Division of Chemical Information of American Chemical Society.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>As one of the top STEM-focused universities in the U.S., Colorado School of Mines (Mines) has increased its research investment and scholarly output exponentially over the last couple of decades. With the growing proportion of research funding from federal agencies and shifting research focus to more collaborative, interdisciplinary, and high-impact directions, the university started to recognize the necessity of open access publishing and research data sharing. Mines Library identified scholarly communication as a new strategic direction and one focus is to develop in-depth partnership with researchers on campus to cultivate an open access culture in dissemination of research output. This presentation will introduce our strategies in starting conversations, identifying champions, forming initiatives, and providing support. We will focus on how a discussion on research profiling and networking system (a.k.a. expert system) could lead to a broader discussion on research information ecosystem. When campus develops a better understanding of research information ecosystem, we will introduce how open access and other best practices can help a healthier research information flow in the ecosystem and what individual researcher can contribute through their daily practices, including openly sharing their publications and research data. Examples of interactions between librarians and chemists as well as other scientists will be used to illustrate our strategies.</p>

    Open Science at Queen''s University'
  description: "<p>This session will present a case study on how Research Administration
    and the Library collaborate at Queen&rsquo;s University in support of open science.
    Key recommendations of The University&rsquo;s Strategic Research Plan (2012&ndash;17)
    include:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Foster knowledge translation where the outcomes of
    our research can benefit society.</li>\n\t<li>Explore evolving emphasis on Open
    Access. Our strong collaborative relationship, including IT Services, creates
    support for Queen&rsquo;s researchers&rsquo; activities from research development
    and grant writing to publishing and impact assessment. This presentation will
    focus on our initiatives to support new, creative solutions to research data management
    and scientific communication that strategically help to manage the growing wave
    of research data, to host research outputs, and to maximise their accessibility.
    Examples of co-operative initiatives include the Queen&rsquo;s Research Data Committee,
    Research Data Day, Scholarly Communications and Research Data Working Groups,
    and the QSpace institutional repository. Several of these are the outcomes of
    a jointly envisioned eScience Strategic Agenda.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Collaboration
    makes it possible for researchers to find the supports and services they need
    in one spot and without duplicating efforts &ndash; administrators and researchers
    alike. One example is a current electronic services project that will enable our
    new CV and annual (faculty member) merit reporting tool to be a mechanism for
    open access deposit into the University&rsquo;s institutional repository. This
    creative solution will facilitate compliance with the soon to be released Open
    Access Policy from the Canadian Tri-Council granting agencies (i.e. SSHRC, CIHR,
    NSERC). Queen&rsquo;s Research Services and the Library are also collaborating
    on the expansion of data management plan services, with the goal of increasing
    availability of research data, data sharing, and increasing the impact of research
    output.</p>\n\n<p>A discussion of Canadian national policy development and initiatives,

  title: Realising the Social Sciences and Humanities for the European Open Science
    Cloud - CLARIN
  description: |-
    <p>The Social Sciences and Humanities Open Science Cloud (SSHOC) is one of the five European Union H2020 Programme &ldquo; INFRA-EOSC-2018&rdquo; recently funded cluster projects (together with ENVRI-FAIR, PANOSC, ESCAPE, EOSC-LIFE) that will leverage and interconnect existing and new infrastructures from the SSH ERICs and foster interdisciplinary research and collaboration.</p>

    <p>An ambitious number of 47 organisations, experienced and skilled in Social Science &amp; Humanities Infrastructures have gathered from all over Europe to collaborate together on SSHOC, the Social Science and Humanities Open Science Cloud project, coordinated by the Consortium of European Social Science Data Archives (CESSDA). The project started its journey in January 2019 and runs through to April 2022 to realise the transition from the current landscape with disciplinary silos and separated e-infrastructure facilities into a fully-fledged cloud-based infrastructure where data are FAIR, tools and training readily accessible, thus providing a significant contribution towards achieving the vision put forward by the European Cloud Initiative - and support the implementation of European Open Science Cloud.</p>

    <p>All SSH ESFRI Landmarks and Projects (CESSDA, ESS, DARIAH, CLARIN and SHARE), relevant international SSH data infrastructures and the Association of European Research Libraries (LIBER) participate in the SSHOC project ensuring an inclusive approach. The consortium has the expertise to cover the whole data cycle: from data creation and curation to optimal re-use of data and can address training and advocacy to increase actual re-use of data. The consortium is also very well placed to address SSH specific challenges such as the distributed character of its infrastructures, multi-linguality, huge internal complexity of some of the data it deals with and secured access to sensitive data.</p>

    <p>The project will pool, harmonize and make easily usable tools and services that will allow to process, enrich, analyse and compare the vast heterogeneous collections of SSH data available across the boundaries of individual repositories or institutions in Europe. The project will build the common SSH Cloud, maximise reuse through Open Science and FAIR principles, interconnect existing and new infrastructures and set up a Governance for SSH-EOSC. The expected impacts of the Social Science and Humanities Open Science Cloud:</p>

    <p>-The social sciences and humanities are seamlessly integrated in the European Open Science Cloud.<br>
    -Availability of an EU wide; easy to use SSH Open Marketplace, where tools and data are openly available.<br>
    -EU wide availability of high quality SSH data.<br>
    -EU wide availability of trusted and secure access mechanisms for SSH data, confirming to EU legal requirements.<br>
    -State of the art advanced through dedicated SSH data pilots cluster projects.<br>
    -Data sharing is the new normal among the different SSH communities.</p>

    <p>CLARIN will bring to SSHOC its expertise in Language Technology, and some of its core technical infrastructure components. Generalizing and adapting our services for processing data from the social sciences and cultural heritage where needed. The SSH will profit from this as CLARIN will from the assets and expertise of the other SSHOC stakeholder infrastructures. Together we will also assure the position of the SSH in the new to develop EOSC.</p>

  title: 'Supporting Diamond Open Access: Research libraries as funders, intermediaries
    and publishers'
  description: |-
    <p>In the ongoing transformation of the scholarly publishing system to Open Access, more and more actors argue that it is important to maintain bibliodiversity in the publishing system. One way to achieve this is by investing not only in transformative agreements with big commercial publishers but also in non-commercial publication models governed by scholarly communities.</p>

    <p>In this panel, we present four different approaches from research libraries that aim to support Diamond Open Access publication initiatives from the scholarly community. Diamond Open Access means that the publication costs are neither financed by library subscriptions nor by article Processing Charges (APCs), but via alternative business models. The four presentations in the panel highlight different roles that research libraries can adopt in supporting Diamond Open Access: libraries as intermediaries, libraries as funders, libraries as providers of publishing infrastructure.</p>

    <p>The first presentation outlines libraries in the role of intermediaries between publishers and authors by establishing Open Access consortia. Libraries have a long-standing expertise in consortial negotiations, yet possibilities for a broad adaptation to APC-free Open Access resources have not been fully explored. In the project KOALA (2021-2023), Technische Informationsbibliothek (TIB) and Communication, Information, Media Centre (KIM) of the University of Konstanz develop a sustainable and scalable business model that offers consortial solutions for financing Diamond Open Access resources.</p>

    <p>The second presentation focuses on the Fund for Fair OA managed by KU Leuven Libraries since 2018. This fund is devoted to providing financial support for non-profit, community-driven approaches to Open Access and Open Scholarship infrastructures. It is thus an important asset in KU Leuven&rsquo;s contribution to collective funding programs which are a typical feature of Diamond Open Access business models. Particular attention will be given to the selection criteria and other practical aspects of managing the fund on a day-to-day basis.</p>

    <p>The third presentation presents a project in which a research library acts as a funder of Diamond Open Access in the disciplines business and economics. With the Open Library Economics (OLEcon), the ZBW &ndash;Leibniz Information Centre for Economics offers funding for scholar-led journals that strive to establish a sustainable Diamond Open Access business model. The presentation is going to highlight learnings from the initial funding period (2021-2023).</p>

    <p>The fourth presentation presents a service where a research library acts as a provider of publishing services. With TIB Open Publishing, the Technische Informationsbibliothek (TIB) offers publishing services to conference organisers and journal editors. The service adheres to high editorial standards and participates in the further development of the free software Open Journal Systems (OJS).</p>

    <p>In the panel, we will discuss the chances and challenges libraries face when starting initiatives to support Diamond Open Access. We will look at the different initiatives&rsquo; specific contexts as well as learnings that can be helpful to initiatives in other countries. We furthermore want to discuss with the audience how support for Diamond Open Access can be implemented in local library strategies.</p>

    <p>The presenters:</p>

    <p>Presentation 1 (KOALA): Sarah Dellmann, Katharina Schulz, Lena Dreher, Martina Benz</p>

  title: What role can Open Science  play in enabling  global knowledge exchange?
  description: |-
    <p><strong>Global threats and challenges resulting from climate change and political crises call for a new agenda to find solutions that work for not just a few but the global community. </strong>To provide more visibility and more opportunities to world-wide scientific discussions to African scientists the region-specific preprint repository AfricArXiv.org is meant to trigger interdisciplinary research within the continent as well as globally with research institutions overseas. The repository is a platform for African scientists to publish their research output immediately and free of cost. This makes it possible for them to receive feedback on their work, improve the manuscript for submission to a peer-reviewed journal and identify potential collaboration partners for future projects.</p>

    <p>Researchers in Africa, Latin America and Southeast Asia now have the opportunity to find up to date research results through online publishing systems, databases and scientific service providers, make their own research output more visible and build transcontinental collaborations more effectively.</p>

    <p>We propose that practiced Open Science allows for more diversity in research output and the convergence of the global scientific community.</p>

    <p>In this discussion, we will address, based on the different experiences with the initiatives mentioned above, how open science can help to facilitate collaboration and the dissemination of knowledge between North and South.</p>

  title: Linked Open Greek Pottery
  description: <p>Linked open data methodologies have tremendous potential in facilitating
    data interoperability, aggregation, and analysis. With lessons learned in the
    development of Nomisma.org, a collaborative project dedicated to the definition
    of numismatic concepts in the semantic web, the authors have endeavored to apply
    these methodologies to the field of Greek pottery, through Kerameikos.org. While
    several thesauri that contain pottery concepts have been published online, not
    all employ linked data, and none of them are &quot;five star&quot; linked data,
    as defined by Berners-Lee. This paper discusses the development of a discipline-specific
    thesaurus which serves as a bridge between existing vocabulary systems, the open
    source XForms/REST/SPARQL framework for its publication, and the development of
    web-based tools to analyse and visualise pottery data aggregated from the Getty
    Museum and British Museum as a proof of concept of the utility of Kerameikos.org
    as a research tool for Greek pottery.</p>

  title: Jisc Open Research Hub – Supporting Open Scholarship
  description: |-
    Jisc's Open Research Hub integrates a number of repository, preservation, reporting and storage platforms as a one stop shop for researchers and research managers. The service offers both open source and proprietary systems and allows data and metadata to be shared openly if required. The platform has been developed through years-long consultation with the UK HE research sector and sector bodies, along with contributions from both in-house Jisc and third-party experts.

    The need for such a solution has arisen from the sector's desires to achieve several, shared aims, including: greater collaboration; tackling the reproducibility crisis; enabling better research; and meeting funder requirements.

    Jisc's custom-built repository—the Open Research Repository—is part of the Jisc Open Research Hub. It's built upon an extensive data model and rich messaging layer, providing users with a clean, simple, and easy-to-learn interface for the deposit, approval, and discovery of a range of outputs.

    Jisc's position in the UK higher education / research sector, as well as the scale of the service provides us with many domain-specific insights to share with OR2019 delegates, ranging from the broad methods mentioned above, down to individual design decisions informed by our research and domain expertise.

  title: Ali-Bey - an open collaborative georeferencing web application
  description: <p>Georeferencing preserved specimens represents a major effort at
    the Museu de Ciències Naturals de Barcelona (MCNB), given the available resources
    and limited staff that can be allocated to the task. Georeferencing is a labour-intensive
    and hard-to-automate task that requires software tools that can help in making
    it as efficient as possible. The tool we present, Ali-Bey, has been slowly developed
    over 15 years and its functionalities have been gradually built in a process of
    development, testing, use in production and refinement, rather than as a single
    development cycle out of a comprehensive specifications requirement document.
    At the start, the MCNB could not find a tool that fully satisfied the requirements
    listed as essential and made the decision to develop a custom tool. At the end,
    the initiative has proved successful since it has delivered a new georeferencing
    tool that meets the MCNB's needs, all in a context of yearly scarce availability
    of funds. The tool has been gradually matured and developed over the years, in
    line with the scarce financing. Only recently, after reaching a notable set of
    novel features, we considered to release it as an open-source project. The MCNB
    has supported its development up until this date and decided to open it in order
    to give the NHC community the opportunity to contribute to its development.</p><p>We
    present the software tool Ali-Bey that provides new functionality for the georeferencing
    of specimens in Natural History Collections, namely the possibility of cooperation
    between different institutions, the traceability of georeferences and the capability
    of managing different versions of a same site name, namely for historical reasons.
    The tool is an open-source web application implemented in Python and the Django
    framework that leverages other commonly-used specialised geodatabase and map server
    tools. An API provides access to the geodatabase to externally-developed tools.
    In addition, for an easy installation, the tool is provided as a multi-container
    Docker application.</p>

  title: 'Open Energy Metadata: Publishing Energy Data Enriched with Ontology References'
  description: |-
    <p>Modelling climate and energy systems is a challenging endeavour. Scientists with different backgrounds, terminology and interests analyse large, complex, interdependent, and regulated systems. Some studies focus only on the electricity sector, while others will partially or fully include other sectors such as heat and transport in their calculations and analyses. Similar data sets are used that originate from different sources, have different temporal and spatial resolutions, different reference years or even divergent underlying sector concepts. For example, some input data is collected manually, while other data is a product of other models and calculations. In this research field, understandability, reproducibility, and collaboration are challenges for the scientific community. A lot of complex data needs to be published in an accessible and self-explanatory way to meet open science standards for software development and research data management.</p>

    <p>A group of scientific institutes from the field of energy research has implemented the idea of creating and using a modular, shared and open research data infrastructure. The Open Energy Family framework is a collection of various tools and information designed to ensure quality, transparency and reproducibility in energy system modelling. It was originally formulated at an early workshop of the openmod initiative and primarily funded by the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi). The main module is the Open Energy Platform (OEP), a web interface that provides access to a community database. It enables the publication of data sets linked to the corresponding source code and underlying assumptions using a standardized metadata format, the Open Energy Metadata (OEMetadata). The format is publicly developed on GitHub and conforms to the Frictionless Datapackage standard. It is a json file that describes the structure and content of adjacent files or database tables. In its latest version (v1.5.0) we have refined it to allow references to ontologies. An ontology is a well-structured and defined description of reality that includes all the elements of<br>
    interest and their interactions. It contains a formal naming and a definition of classes, properties and their relationships. An ontology can serve as a reference for concepts, terms and definitions within a particular domain of discourse. The Open Energy Ontology (OEO), a collaborative effort, aims to create a common ontology for energy system modelling.</p>

    <p>The poster introduces our approach, combining standardized metadata with references to a domain ontology. We describe the structure and content of the OEMetadata standard and the semantic methods of the OEO. Applying an ontology to data annotations in databases and metadata allows flexible, content-oriented data integration and aggregation. It also offers the possibility of advanced searching functions and logical queries across data sets. With this connection, we can ensure that research data can be annotated in a well-defined and unambiguous way, making the data understandable and reusable.<br>

  title: 'On the positive side: towards fully compliant open workflows'
  description: |-
    <p>What could a fully commons-compliant workflow look like? Many changes currently sweeping through scholarly communication as well as those proposed by the avant garde in various stakeholder groups focus on openness, efficiency and equity. For such changes to take effect researchers and other stakeholders need to be aware, able and incentivized. A crucial condition here is that desired practices are supported by compliant tools and platforms throughout the research workflow. Those tools and platforms should be compliant with frameworks setting criteria for open, efficient and equitable infrastructures. This session uses two of those frameworks (The FORCE11 scholarly commons principles and the Principles for Open Scholarly Infrastructures) to present an example set of compliant tools and platforms that can be recognized as realistic and useful. The selection of that set reflects two years of discussions, workshops and webinars. It is not the one and final answer though. It is intended to spark further discussion as much as to be put to immediate use. In a discussion we will determine potential uses of such a compliant workflow examples, explore the borders and greyness in compliance checking and gauge the importance of interoperability, discipline specificity and any gaps remaining. We plan to use an accompanying interactive poster to collect and present input from participants during the conference.<br>
    <br>
    This presentation reflects the collaborative work of the scholarly commons working group.</p>

  title: Workshop at the Dutch Open Science Festival 2022 - Getting Started in Citizen
    Science with the Principles & the Quality Matrix
  description: |-
    <p>Citizen Science methods and approaches are becoming increasingly well recognised as an important means to bring science and society together in closer collaboration - they are embedded in the formally adopted UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science, described and supported in the recently ratified new legal instruments within the Aarhus convention, are emphasised throughout the Horizon Europe funding programme, and form the third pillar of the National Programme Open Science in the Netherlands.</p>

    <p>However, for career researchers it is not always clear where to start. To address this, members of the community of Citizen Science practitioners in the Netherlands formed a Working Group that was supported by the Dutch National Programme Open Science (NPOS) to address questions such as - &lsquo;Where do you start?&rsquo;, &lsquo;What are the pitfalls?&rsquo;, &lsquo;How do you set up effective communication between professional scientists and citizen scientists?&rsquo;, &lsquo;How do you guarantee the quality of the process and outcomes?&rsquo; , and &lsquo;How can the collaboration become sustainable?&rsquo;&nbsp;</p>

    <p>In this interactive workshop, members of the Working Group will present the resource that they developed to answer these questions - the Citizen Science Quality Matrix - which builds on The 10 Principles for Citizen Science of the European Citizen Science Association (ECSA). The Matrix translates these principles into success factors that provide guidance when designing and assessing citizen science projects, with a focus on both scientific and societal quality.</p>

    Open Science
  description: |-
    <p>Plan P - A Publishers&rsquo; Offer to Institutions and Funders to Transform to Open Science</p>

    <p>Plan P (<a href="http://planp.science">http://planp.science</a>) is JMIR Publication&rsquo;s collaborative proposal for truly open scholarly communications and a framework for academic institutions and funders to facilitate a transformation towards Open Science. Plan P supports a &ldquo;preprint first&rdquo; publication model (PRC: Preprint - Review - Curate) by creating a platform for rapid AI-supported peer-review of preprints, editorial prospecting of preprints, and publication of curated peer-reviewed preprints in the overlay journal series JMIRx or - via a &ldquo;manuscript marketplace&rdquo; - in any other journal. Hashtag communities are peer-review communities, which include traditional journals but can also be other communities around a certain topical interest, can be targeted by preprint authors by using hashtags in their abstract and are being credited in published preprints. Plan P is also a business model that distributes the costs for peer-review and publication between institutions and funders. Encouragement of Registered Reports is another aspect of Plan P. Finally, Plan P creates research assessment metrics for institutions that go beyond citation-based approaches, measuring adherence to open science best practices. The ultimate goal of this endeavor is to develop the easiest path for authors to create transparent work by cataloging their entire research effort - from methodology to preliminary results and on to publication - as well as creating an environment for librarians where the needs of their budgets and institution do not conflict with their Open Science goals.</p>

    <p>Join Dr Gunther Eysenbach, founder and CEO of JMIR, as he presents this exciting plan to accelerate the move to Open Science. We would be thrilled to present to the FORCE2021 audience, given their interest in disruptive technologies and appreciation of the need for more open and equitable publishing solutions.</p>

  description: "<p>Data Management Plans (DMPs) and Data Availability Statements (DAS)
    provide context on activities and outcomes in Research Data Management Lifecycles
    (RDMLs) and encompass different aspects of the scholarly communication process.
    On the one hand, DMPs ensure researchers&rsquo; compliance with research funding
    and research organizations&rsquo; requirements, to carefully manage and appropriately
    share research data and outputs. On the other hand, DAS are integrated into scientific
    publishers&#39; workflows to promote the availability of their publications&rsquo;
    underlying research data and outputs. Efforts are underway to standardize the
    structure and content of DMPs and DAS at both technical and policy levels. In
    this session you will hear from four key stakeholder groups regarding their approaches
    towards addressing challenges and opportunities in DMPs and DAS:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Dutch
    Research Council (NWO) - Champions research data management policy alignment with
    research funders in Europe. One of the first organizations to implement Science

    <p>This entry has been realised in the framework of the H2020-MSCA-RISE-2018 project &ldquo;LoGov - Local Government and the Changing Urban-Rural Interplay&rdquo;. LoGov aims to provide solutions for local governments that address the fundamental challenges resulting from urbanisation. To address this complex issue, 18 partners from 17 countries and six continents share their expertise and knowledge in the realms of public law, political science, and public administration. LoGov identifies, evaluates, compares, and shares innovative practices that cope with the impact of changing urban-rural relations in five major local government areas: (1) local responsibilities and public services, (2) local financial arrangements, (3) structure of local government, (4) intergovernmental relations of local governments, and (5) people&rsquo;s participation in local decision-making.</p>

    <p>The present entry addresses intergovernmental relations of local governments in Argentina. The entry forms part of the LoGov Report on Argentina. To access the full version of the report on Argentina, other practices regarding intergovernmental relations of local governments and to receive more information about the project, please visit: https://www.logov-rise.eu/.

  title: 'Exploring mutuality: A report on independent open access publications in
    the social sciences'
  description: |-
    <p>In early 2020, Libraria received support from a group of U.S. research libraries to pursue a feasibility study for the Cooperate for Open project. The project, which focused on born-OA, diamond OA, and/or scholar-led open access publications in anthropology and adjacent fields, aimed to identify a model for sustaining these publications, while reducing the risk and workload often associated with this segment of the publishing landscape.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>This feasibility study gathered data through a survey conducted in late 2020, which resulted in 53 responses, and a series of discussion groups held in January 2021 with a total of sixteen individuals representing seventeen publications. As the findings outlined below demonstrate, the publications represented in this study present a cohort defined by difference in certain respects, but united in shared motivations and priorities.</p>

    <p>This report argues that leveraging the diverse strengths and resources of this cohort of publications calls for an approach defined by cooperation and reciprocal support. The conceptual framework that most closely reflected the aspirations and principles shared by participant publications was that of mutual aid. Mutual aid can be said to prioritize forms of support and care offered within a community&mdash;where support is not predicated on adherence to norms or standards, and resources are directed toward local or context-driven solutions.</p>

  title: Atmospheric Sciences Perspectives on Integrated, Coordinated, Open, Networked
    (ICON) Science
  description: <p>This collaborative article discusses the opportunities and challenges
    of adopting integrated, coordinated, open, and networked (ICON) principles in
    atmospheric sciences. From the global nature of the atmosphere, there has always
    been a need for atmospheric science to be an ICON science. With the help of evolving
    technology, it is possible to go further in implementing and spreading the ICON
    principles for productive global collaboration. In particular, technology transfer
    and applications could be approached with reproducibility in mind, and data-sharing
    infrastructure could enable easier and better international collaboration. There
    are, however, various challenges in following the ICON principles in the acquisition,
    quality control, and maintenance of data, and the publication of results in a
    systematic way. Moreover, the extent of such issues varies geographically and
    hence poses different challenges to implementing ICON principles. In this commentary
    article, we briefly state our perspectives on the state of ICON, challenges we
    have met, and future opportunities. Furthermore, we describe how atmospheric science
    researchers have benefited from these collaborative multi-dimensional approaches
    that fulfill the core goal of ICON.</p>

  description: '<p>The EU&#39;s scientific potential is increasingly flowing into
    the world of new scientific knowledge. The object of this paper is the communication
    interpretation of the Open Science policy, covering not only access and storage
    of scientific information and preservation of scientific information, but communication
    aspects also. <em>Purpose of the study: </em>Establish modern trends in the scientific
    ecosystem oriented towards facilitating the publication and communication of scientific
    results. <em>Tasks of the study:</em> Compare new solutions in science communication
    models in the most popular platforms, and explore what is the alternative to traditional
    scientific journals. <em>Methodology/approach:</em> The qualitative systematic
    review (qualitative evidence synthesis), scientific criticism of sociological
    surveys, methods of analytic and synthetic processing of primary and secondary
    resources, secondary data analysis and overview of scientific publications available
    in the libraries worldwide, have been used to obtain data about the impact of
    new EU solutions: the European Road Map for development of the European Research
    Area (ERA), the European Strategy Forum for Research Infrastructures (ESFRI),
    the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, etc. A comparative
    analysis of innovation in publishing platforms was conducted with special attention
    to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation&#39;s <em>Gates Open Research </em>platform.
    <em>Results: </em>The creators of the <em>Gates Open Research</em> platform defend
    the view of the rapid and socially beneficial effect of new and publicly-accepted
    scientific knowledge. The cutting-edge solutions are: transfer power from the
    hands of editors to the hands of the authors; minimize barriers or gatekeepers
    on the path of the new scientific outcome for society; assessment of the research
    not in view of the venue of publication but on the basis of the intrinsic value
    of the completed study; minimize the funds invested in publishing and dissemination.
    <em>Implications:</em> The conclusions can be important in identifying technological
    and ideological regularities for optimizing the model of scientific publications
    and increasing the speed and visibility of any scientific news.</p>'

  title: 'Citizen Science and Open Data: a model for Invasive Alien Species in Europe'
  description: '<p>Invasive Alien Species (IAS) are a growing threat to Europe''s
    biodiversity. The implementation of European Union Regulation on IAS can benefit
    from the involvement of the public in IAS recording and management through Citizen
    Science (CS) initiatives. Aiming to tackle issues related with the use of CS projects
    on IAS topics, a dedicated workshop titled "<i>Citizen Science and Open Data:
    a model for Invasive Alien Species in Europe</i>" was organized by the Joint Research
    Centre (JRC) and the European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST Association).
    Fifty key stakeholders from all Europe, including two Members of the European
    Parliament, attended the workshop. With a clear focus on IAS, the workshop aimed
    at addressing the following issues: a) CS and policy, b) citizen engagement, and
    c) CS data management. Nine short presentations provided input on CS and IAS issues.
    Participants discussed specific topics in several round tables ("<i>world café</i>"
    style) and reported back their conclusions to the audience and full assembly moderated
    discussions. Overall, the workshop enabled the sharing of ideas, approaches and
    best practices regarding CS and IAS. Specific opportunities and pitfalls of using
    CS data in the whole policy cycle for IAS were recognized. Concerning the implementation
    of the IAS Regulation, CS data could complement official surveillance systems,
    and contribute to the early warning of the IAS of Union concern after appropriate
    validation by the Member States'' competent authorities. CS projects can additionally
    increase awareness and empower citizens. Attendees pointed out the importance
    for further public engagement in CS projects on IAS that demonstrate specific
    initiatives and approaches and analyze lessons learned from past experiences.
    In addition, the workshop noted that the data gathered from different CS projects
    on IAS are fragmented. It highlighted the need for using an open and accessible
    platform to upload data originating from CS sources or to mirror validated data
    into a single, easy-to-use web service, in line with the EU Open Science Strategic
    Priority. The workshop provided ten key recommendations of best practices for
    CS projects on IAS, addressed to researchers, policy makers and implementing authorities,
    indicating future research and policy directions and opportunities.</p>'

  title: 'Community-building in action: The Open Access Books Network'
  description: "<p>This talk will focus on the Open Access Books Network, an international
    community that brings together researchers, publishers, librarians, and anyone
    else interested in open access books. Launched in September 2020 and coordinated
    by representatives of DOAB/OAPEN, OPERAS, SPARC Europe, and ScholarLed, the OABN
    has quickly grown to include over 300 members. We stage talks and workshops, share
    knowledge and best practices, and bust myths about open access books&mdash;and
    all this during a global pandemic, when community exchange has been challenged
    as never before and the vulnerabilities of closed systems of knowledge-sharing
    have been starkly exposed.</p>\n\n<p>This paper will present an overview of the
    activities of the OABN, sharing the techniques we used to create a strong and
    enthusiastic community built around the idea of openness, and the strategies with
    which we have aimed to narrow the gap between researchers and the OA books community
    at large. As well as fostering a thriving digital hub on Humanities Commons and
    an extended community on social media, we have organised opportunities to share
    and learn from each others&rsquo; experiences using digital events, workshops,
    and video resources, including:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>the OA Books Workout series
    where researchers share their creative open book publishing stories in live, recorded,
    and written formats</li>\n\t<li>a mythbusting resource where experts address common
    myths and challenges related to open access publishing frequently faced by researchers</li>\n\t<li>talks
    from scholar-publishers, such as Jeff Pooley of mediastudies.press and from the
    team at COPIM, who are building infrastructure to support small-scale, academic-led
    OA publishing</li>\n\t<li>and our most significant series so far Voices from the
    OA Books Community, which gathered 476 registrants in total to explore different
    aspects of policy for OA books. We heard from researchers, publishers, funders,
    OA policymakers, librarians, and infrastructure providers from all over the world
    to discuss the strengths and weaknesses of different policy outcomes for OA books
    from a broad range of perspectives. SPARC Europe synthesised these discussions
    and we took the results to cOAlition S, who have subsequently recognised the OABN
    as &ldquo;an open forum for community input during the implementation process&rdquo;
    of their recommendations for OA books. This series proved that the research community
    can come together to help shape the future of OA books, and that a community like
    the OABN can be a powerful way to make that happen.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The OABN
    brings together the OA books community at large, including researchers in their
    respective roles as book authors, publishers or simply OA enthusiasts. By sharing
    the growth of the Open Access Books Network from an idea discussed between colleagues
    to a thriving community-based network, we hope to inspire others at LIBER to develop
    similar Communities of Practice that bring researchers together in groups related
    to their own interests and ambitions for the future of scholarly communication.</p>"

  title: Case studies on Open Science in the context of ERC projects - Set 2
  description: "<p>This document presents the second of five sets of case studies
    that have been produced in the framework of the <em>&lsquo;Study on open access
    to publications and research data management and sharing within ERC projects&rsquo;.
    </em>This study has been procured by the ERC Executive Agency under contract number
    ERCEA/A1/2016/06.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The following three case studies are included
    in this set:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Harnessing Proto-Enzymes for Novel Catalytic Functions
    (CompEnzymeEvolution)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Lynn Kamerlin, a Professor at Uppsala
    University and the lead of the project <a href=\"http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/104436_en.html\">CompEnzymeEvolution</a>
    applies computational methodologies to study protein evolution and to design new
    catalytic functions. In this context, Professor Kamerlin highlights some of the
    benefits and challenges that her team has encountered when applying open science
    practices in their research environment, particularly related to managing research
    data and the costs of open access publishing.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Dynamics of Local
    Transcriptomes and Proteomes in Neurons (Neuronal Dynamics)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>When
    Professor Erin Schuman received an ERC Advanced grant for her project <a href=\"http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/102025_en.html\">Neuronal
    Dynamics</a>, there were no formal requirements for PIs to publish articles in
    open access or share their research data openly. Still, most of the publications
    derived from the project have been published in open access and research data
    has been deposited in publicly accessible databases. Professor Schuman sees clear
    benefits that publishing in open access and opening research data could bring
    to science.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Neural circuits underlying complex brain function
    across animals - from conserved core concepts to specializations defining a species&rsquo;
    identity (BrainInBrain)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The small field of insect neurophysiology
    has until now lacked a repository of openly shared data to help researchers collaborate
    on cross-species analysis of specific brain regions. But there is significant
    potential for such a repository to yield fresh understanding of decision-making,
    intentionality and navigation. Associate Professor Stanley Heinze, of Lund University,
    leads the <a href=\"http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/207379_en.html\">BrainInBrain</a>
    project, an ERC Starting Grant exploring how a region known as the central complex
    helps insects know their direction. Heinze explains the key role the <em>Insect
    Brain Database</em> plays in sharing and visualising images produced from the
    research. He describes how this resource helps researchers find and share the
    relevant knowledge to aid discovery, and his strategies to address the challenge
    of sustaining the resource for the longer term.</p>"

  title: Intellectual Property, Open Science and Research Biobanks
  description: '<p>In biomedical research and translational medicine, the ancient
    war between exclusivity (private control over information) and access to information
    is proposing again on a new battlefield: research biobanks. The latter are becoming
    increasingly important (one of the ten ideas changing the world, according to
    Time magazine) since they allow to collect, store and distribute in a secure and
    professional way a critical mass of human biological samples for research purposes.
    Tissues and related data are fundamental for the development of the biomedical
    research and the emerging field of translational medicine: they represent the
    &ldquo;raw material&rdquo; for every kind of biomedical study. For this reason,
    it is crucial to understand the boundaries of Intellectual Property (IP) in this
    prickly context. In fact, both data sharing and collaborative research have become
    an imperative in contemporary open science, whose development depends inextricably
    on: the opportunities to access and use data, the possibility of sharing practices
    between communities, the cross-checking of information and results and, chiefly,
    interactions with experts in different fields of knowledge. Data sharing allows
    both to spread the costs of analytical results that researchers cannot achieve
    working individually and, if properly managed, to avoid the duplication of research.
    These advantages are crucial: access to a common pool of pre-competitive data
    and the possibility to endorse follow-on research projects are fundamental for
    the progress of biomedicine. This is why the &quot;open movement&quot; is also
    spreading in the biobank&#39;s field. After an overview of the complex interactions
    among the different stakeholders involved in the process of information and data
    production, as well as of the main obstacles to the promotion of data sharing
    (i.e., the appropriability of biological samples and information, the privacy
    of participants, the lack of interoperability), we will firstly clarify some blurring
    in language, in particular concerning concepts often mixed up, such as &ldquo;open
    source&rdquo; and &ldquo;open access&rdquo;. The aim is to understand whether
    and to what extent we can apply these concepts to the biomedical field. Afterwards,
    adopting a comparative perspective, we will analyze the main features of the open
    models &ndash; in particular, the Open Research Data model &ndash; which have
    been proposed in literature for the promotion of data sharing in the field of
    research biobanks. After such an analysis, we will suggest some recommendations
    in order to rebalance the clash between exclusivity - the paradigm characterizing
    the evolution of intellectual property over the last three centuries - and the
    actual needs for access to knowledge. We argue that the key factor in this balance
    may come from the right interaction between IP, social norms and contracts. In
    particular, we need to combine the incentives and the reward mechanisms characterizing
    scientific communities with data sharing imperative.</p>'

  title: Realising the Social Sciences and Humanities for the European Open Science
    Cloud - EOSC Hub
  description: |-
    <p>The Social Sciences and Humanities Open Science Cloud (SSHOC) is one of the five European Union H2020 Programme &ldquo; INFRA-EOSC-2018&rdquo; recently funded cluster projects (together with ENVRI-FAIR, PANOSC, ESCAPE, EOSC-LIFE) that will leverage and interconnect existing and new infrastructures from the SSH ERICs and foster interdisciplinary research and collaboration.</p>

    <p>An ambitious number of 47 organisations, experienced and skilled in Social Science &amp; Humanities Infrastructures have gathered from all over Europe to collaborate together on SSHOC, the Social Science and Humanities Open Science Cloud project, coordinated by the Consortium of European Social Science Data Archives (CESSDA). The project started its journey in January 2019 and runs through to April 2022 to realise the transition from the current landscape with disciplinary silos and separated e-infrastructure facilities into a fully-fledged cloud-based infrastructure where data are FAIR, tools and training readily accessible, thus providing a significant contribution towards achieving the vision put forward by the European Cloud Initiative - and support the implementation of European Open Science Cloud.</p>

    <p>All SSH ESFRI Landmarks and Projects (CESSDA, ESS, DARIAH, CLARIN and SHARE), relevant international SSH data infrastructures and the Association of European Research Libraries (LIBER) participate in the SSHOC project ensuring an inclusive approach. The consortium has the expertise to cover the whole data cycle: from data creation and curation to optimal re-use of data and can address training and advocacy to increase actual re-use of data. The consortium is also very well placed to address SSH specific challenges such as the distributed character of its infrastructures, multi-linguality, huge internal complexity of some of the data it deals with and secured access to sensitive data.</p>

    <p>The project will pool, harmonize and make easily usable tools and services that will allow to process, enrich, analyse and compare the vast heterogeneous collections of SSH data available across the boundaries of individual repositories or institutions in Europe. The project will build the common SSH Cloud, maximise reuse through Open Science and FAIR principles, interconnect existing and new infrastructures and set up a Governance for SSH-EOSC. The expected impacts of the Social Science and Humanities Open Science Cloud:</p>

    <p>-The social sciences and humanities are seamlessly integrated in the European Open Science Cloud.<br>
    -Availability of an EU wide; easy to use SSH Open Marketplace, where tools and data are open available.<br>
    -EU wide availability of high quality SSH data.<br>
    -EU wide availability of trusted and secure access mechanisms for SSH data, confirming to EU legal requirements.<br>
    -State of the art advanced through dedicated SSH data pilots cluster projects.<br>
    -Data sharing is the new normal among the different SSH communities.</p>

    <p>A task force will be set up with EOSC-hub project to exchange and harmonize views on common themes, and existing contacts with other European and international organizations operating in and around the EOSC space will be invited to engage in the process.</p>

  title: 'Promote Open Science within the DRIIHM Interdisciplinary Research Facility
    on Human- Environment Interactions: Co-design of an e-infrastructure implementing
    the FAIR Principles'
  description: |-
    <p>As part of the international Open Science movement, this project deals with the structuration, sharing and opening of research data in the context of a network of thirteen CNRS-INEE observatories (OHMs): the Interdisciplinary Research Facility on Human-Environment Interactions supported by the ANR (LabEx DRIIHM 2012-2025). This network involves nearly 1000 scientists. Large amounts of heterogeneous data are produced or collected, covering research in Natural and Life Sciences, and Human and Social Sciences. Several initiatives have been carried out within the LabEx DRIIHM to increase visibility and data sharing to connect scientific teams that are not always linked, promote the re-use of data and potentially lead to the emergence of new research topics. A range of tools has been developed over the years: metadata geo-catalogs, web GIS platforms, photo libraries, HAL collections, etc. However, there are significant contrasts in the contribution to these tools and their use between OHMs, and two surveys conducted in 2017 and 2018 showed that researchers remain poorly informed about Open Science practices. The DRIIHM community is globally motivated by data sharing, but does not know how to proceed and identifies obstacles such as fear of hacking, misuse, security or loss of data ownership.</p>

    <p>The objective of this project is to optimize the appropriation of Open Science by the DRIIHM community through: i) the organization of awareness campaigns showing the benefits of data sharing and openness; ii) the co-construction of a more ergonomic and interoperable e-infrastructure, integrating existing tools and accompanying researchers to find, share and (re-)use data through the concrete and gradual implementation of the FAIR principles. This project is part of international initiatives such as the Research Data Alliance and GO FAIR.</p>

    <p>This Flash call offers the opportunity to strengthen the collaboration recently initiated with ergonomists and web development specialists to respond more closely to the community health needs and highly improve the existing infrastructure. The methodology is based on an iterative and incremental AGILE software development: the e-infrastructure will be enhanced with new features after each iteration. The originality of this project lies in the co-construction, researchers being involved at the early stages of the project. Challenges are to identify the current practices in data management and data access, and then to manage change with the integration of Open Science practices into the data lifecycle. Training workshops will enable the DRIIHM community to learn how to use and evaluate the new e-infrastructure efficiently. Indicators will be developed to measure the evolution of practices, the usability of the e-infrastructure and the level of data FAIRness.</p>

    <p>The impacts of this project will be the directly quantifiable use of the e-infrastructure by the community of data producers and users. As a result, researchers will acquire a better knowledge of Open Science and their datasets will gain in visibility. They will be aware of data management using a Data Management Plan model and will have the opportunity to generate a data paper draft. The e-infrastructure source codes will be freely accessible and maintained on a dedicated repository platform. The scientific production will be open access and referenced in HAL. The methodological solutions developed and tested in this is project can be exploited beyond the LabEx DRIIHM. Finally, through the implementation of interoperability, research data will be visible in major national and international data infrastructures including the future European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) portal.</p>

  title: Building communities of practice around environmental open data science
  description: '<p>Environmental scientists are a diverse community that ranges from
    climatologists to geneticists, but we are united by an enormous need to work efficiently
    with data &ndash; and by the fact that we seldom have formal computing or data
    analysis training of any kind. There is great opportunity to borrow from the work
    of software engineers and use collaborative open tools that facilitate better
    science in less time. However, a fundamental shift is needed in the environmental
    science community that prioritizes data science and provides emerging scientific
    leaders training in open science tools and practices to strengthen and accelerate
    their work. I will discuss my work to catalyze this shift at the National Center
    for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) at the University of California
    at Santa Barbara. Building from our <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0160">open

  title: '12.2 Open and Reproducible Analytical Workflows in the Humanities: The Case
    of Finnish Bibliographic Metadata'
  description: |-
    <p>The principles of open science are often applauded, but in the humanities rarely implemented in practice. This will change with concrete proof of the usefulness of shared open research data and methods in collaborative projects (including libraries, researchers, data management, faculty and students). Our idea is to establish and study Reproducible Analytical Workflows (RAW) by constructing open source environments that combine data and information resources, statistical analysis and automated reports. To introduce the RAW model to the humanities in Finland, we are launching a pilot project at the University of Helsinki based on our earlier experiments with early modern British and American metadata investigating the ESTC within a reproducible workflow to provide transparent quantitative analysis of knowledge production: https://github. com/rOpenGov/estc/blob/master/inst/examples/summary.md</p>

    <p>This paper considers similar tools constructed to analyse the Finnish National Bibliography (1488&ndash;1917) based on the same quantitative and open source research tools that we developed in the context of the British Library Data Collections. Our aim is to make these methods widely known and accessible, reaching university education already at an undergraduate level. Integrating the services of data management infrastructure is an important component of the automated workflow. FIN-CLARIN, hosting the language bank of Finland, offers a repository for the bibliographic data and a search engine, which enables the students and teachers to select and download data samples using a familiar search environment. The data can be further processed with standard analytical tools and compared with visualizations of the original data. Researchers and more advanced students may venture into modifying the visualizations for their own purposes as reproducible statistical workflows.</p>

    <p>The University Library information literacy education will further integrate the RAW model in the curriculum. In order to introduce students to open data methods, teaching will start with a simple interface and samples, and aim at real research use of the data and creating an understanding of data, methods, collaboration and reporting in the open science process so that the whole becomes constructively aligned. A problem-driven approach to teaching and supporting the work with teamwork and social tools will enhance the learning outcomes. Open science workflow involves the library at every step of the way.</p>

    <p><strong>Professor Mikko Tolonen</strong>&nbsp;has a background in intellectual history. His monograph, Mandeville and Hume: Anatomists of Civil Society, published in Oxford University Studies in the Enlightenment in 2013 combined the study of history of philosophy and book history. According to some reviews, it was a pioneering approach. Currently he continues his efforts to use book history to answer research questions in the tradition of intellectual history in a multidisciplinary project with a data scientist&nbsp;<strong>Dr Leo Lahti.</strong>&nbsp;Previously he has collaborated widely internationally, for example, publishing with Noel Malcolm about Thomas Hobbes&rsquo;s correspondence based on the use of auction sale catalogues.</p>

  title: 'Human Factors Impacting Open Data Availability: Individual Perspectives
    On Data Sharing'
  description: |-
    <p>This is a presentation delivered as part of Ocean Sciences Meeting 2022 (AGU/ASLO/TOS), in session&nbsp;OD07: Sharing the Wealth: Overcoming Barriers and Finding Opportunities for Community-Based Solutions to Data Sharing. A video of this presentation being delivered is available here:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxuabDp-LrQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxuabDp-LrQ</a></p>

    <p>We present the results of a scoping review on how human factors introduce or influence barriers to sharing open data, and what interventions have been attempted to mitigate these barriers. Ocean research is undergoing a transition from data scarcity to data abundance, which requires a fundamental shift in how we view data: from a resource to be protected to a resource we can only effectively utilize through collaboration. Organizations and funding agencies generally recognize the importance of sharing research data openly. Yet the psychology of scarcity is a powerful, enduring force on individuals. &nbsp; Our review included literature from the past decade that mentioned open data or research data in proximity to discussions of barriers, factors, and other synonyms. Our initial search retrieved 1200+ articles, of which 58 met all inclusion criteria. These papers varied in geography, methods, year of publication, and scope. We extracted all primary results relevant to our review and produced a narrative synthesis. &nbsp; We conclude individual perspectives will always be intertwined with factors like organizational structures, incentive systems, resource availability, and perceptions of institutional culture (system-level factors). In fact, personal opinion on the benefits of data sharing influences whether individuals perceive barriers or not. &nbsp;There has been little work to disentangle these factors. &nbsp;We will summarize the human factors identified in the literature in five themes: perceived lack of time/resources; a lack of organizational / institutional norms (&ldquo;culture&rdquo;); concern about not having the skills required; concern that they would not be able to benefit from their data collection work, including initial publication and appropriate credit; and the possibility that mistakes would be discovered. We&rsquo;ll also reflect on how the results influence our user engagement practices at the Canadian Integrated Ocean Observing System (CIOOS) Atlantic.</p>

  title: Jisc Open Research Hub – Supporting Open Scholarship
  description: |-
    Jisc's Open Research Hub integrates a number of repository, preservation, reporting and storage platforms as a one stop shop for researchers and research managers. The service offers both open source and proprietary systems and allows data and metadata to be shared openly if required. The platform has been developed through years-long consultation with the UK HE research sector and sector bodies, along with contributions from both in-house Jisc and third-party experts.

    The need for such a solution has arisen from the sector's desires to achieve several, shared aims, including: greater collaboration; tackling the reproducibility crisis; enabling better research; and meeting funder requirements.

    Jisc's custom-built repository—the Open Research Repository—is part of the Jisc Open Research Hub. It's built upon an extensive data model and rich messaging layer, providing users with a clean, simple, and easy-to-learn interface for the deposit, approval, and discovery of a range of outputs.

    Jisc's position in the UK higher education / research sector, as well as the scale of the service provides us with many domain-specific insights to share with OR2019 delegates, ranging from the broad methods mentioned above, down to individual design decisions informed by our research and domain expertise.

    <p>This report and policy brief were&nbsp;commissioned by the African Science Granting Councils&rsquo; Initiative (SCGI) as a motivating contribution for the theme of the Science Granting Council&rsquo;s 2019 Annual Forum in Tanzania: Open Science in Research and Innovation for Development.&nbsp; The report explores the impact of the digital revolution; describes&nbsp;the array of essential tools and processes required for the new paradigm of open science; and&nbsp;highlights the magnitude of the task of building a strong open science capacity on the contemporary framework of African science and its open science activities.&nbsp; Having identified the&nbsp;crucial enablers of open science that need to be put in place and inhibitors that need to be minimised or removed, the report the presents a series of recommendations.</p>

    <p>The strength of the Science Granting Councils lies in their intermediary position between governments and the science community, influencing and being influenced by both. Acting as a collective, they could achieve efficiencies of scale, stimulate virtual critical masses, intra- African collaboration and enhanced impact. They should consider the timely creation of an African open science area. They should explore the potential for convergence of relevant national policies, for radical changes in the modes of scientific communication and the use of science evaluation metrics. They should explore means of federating IT systems. They should engage with stakeholders in plotting a way forward, including governments, policymakers and science academies; researchers and their institutions, particularly the universities; and international supporters in seeking greater strategic convergence between their respective priorities.</p>

  title: 'Open Science Policy Brief for Penilaian Angka Kredit: Transparency and Credibility
    for World-Class Academics'
  description: |-
    <p><strong>Background</strong></p>

    <p>On the 24th of November, 2020, the Indonesian Open Science Team met the DIKTI Director-General, Prof. Nizam, to discuss policy recommendations to help realize world-class Indonesian higher education institutions and academics. Afterwards, he requested a policy brief, as inputs for the upcoming amendments to the <em>&lsquo;Penilaian Angka Kredit</em>&rsquo;, a career evaluation and advancement system for Indonesian academics. If metrics and evaluation determines the type of academics, it begs the question, what type of academics do we want? Currently, the P.A.K focuses heavily on publications; however, to boost publication count academics use various methods, including but not limited to: being first author on research produced and written by students, selling out Indonesian natural resources to international researchers to be included in publications, self-plagiarism and self-citation, and neglecting national interests for their own. However, publications are not to be neglected, as they help us communicate our findings to the global audience. Therefore, we would like to make recommendations to a) produce academics that have impact to society and serve national interests, b) increase transparency to address poor practices in research and still gauge quality in a meaningful way. In other words, we would like to recommend changes so that we produce academics that have benefit to society, produce credible and useful research, rather than focusing solely on publications.</p>

    <p>Note that among discussed practices are self-plagiarism and whether preprints fall under this umbrella. We would like to strongly emphasise that publishing preprints do not fall under self-plagiarism as preprints have, do and will not ever be identified as a published journal publication. Therefore, any automated system should not identify preprints as journal publications.</p>

    <p>We acknowledge that evaluating work is an evolving and difficult subject; however, much attention and progress has been made recently to properly evaluating the work produced by academics, such DORA and Leiden Manifesto.</p>

    <p><strong>Conclusions</strong></p>

    <p>Ultimately, these metrics are designed to shape the type of academics we desire in our country. The guidelines we have proposed hope to produce academics that in turn will produce credible and useful research that can be used to build the country, and the world through science. This philosophy is being adopted globally, as the lack of transparency increases an individual&#39;s ability to game the system, and thus produces research output that may seem good, but have absolutely no applicable value whatsoever. Thus, in order to properly gauge an academic, we must be transparent in their practices, conduct article-level assessment while considering OA journals, and last but not least, consider their impact beyond publications. We hope that the policy brief is able to encourage this.</p>

    <p>For further reading on academic evaluation for impact rather than publication, we recommend reading the San Francisco Declaration of Research Assessment as well as the Leiden Manifesto for research metrics.</p>

    artists, etc. This persistent identifier is used by numerous libraries, publishers,
    databases, and rights management organisations around the world in order to uniquely
    identify persons and organisations involved in creative activities. The use of
    ISNI offers many affordances: it guarantees a reliable identification and resolves
    the problem of name ambiguity in search and discovery, it enables machine readable
    and language independent data exchange, and &ndash;&nbsp;being widely diffused
    on the open web as a bridge identifier across multiple domains&nbsp;&ndash; it

    Open Data (LOD) are structured, machine readable data, that are freely available
    on the web and connected to other data. LOD build upon RDF, a standard to describe
    facts in the form of <em>triples</em>: &ldquo;subject &ndash; predicate &ndash;
    object&rdquo;. Tim Berners-Lee proposed 4&nbsp;principles to publish&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html\">Linked
    Data</a>:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Use&nbsp;URIs as names for things.</li>\n\t<li>Use&nbsp;HTTP&nbsp;URIs
    so that people can look up those names.</li>\n\t<li>When someone looks up a&nbsp;URI,
    provide useful information, using the standards (RDF, SPARQL).</li>\n\t<li>Include
    links to other&nbsp;URIs, so that people can discover more things.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>LOD
    are a gold standard for both enriching and maximising the (re)use of cultural
    heritage data, and thus indispensable for any GLAM-institution or research centre
    that wishes to improve access to its collections as data, enhance its user experience
    or contribute to open science.</p>\n\n<p>Despite these affordances and the many
    policies and platforms to support the move to Open Data, the public availability
    of cultural heritage data is still limited and the implementation of linked data
    technologies remains rare in Belgium.</p>\n\n<p>By bringing together key actors
    that are already actively implementing LOD, as well as those that are just starting
    this transition, the LOD-ISNI network will organise several activities with the
    purpose of sharing knowledge on best practices, including regular meetings, workshops
    and trainings, as well as an international conference. By discussing state-of-the-art
    solutions and practical problems, the LOD-ISNI network will empower the cultural
    heritage sector and research institutions in their transition from siloed databases
    to linked data. In sum, LOD-ISNI allows KBR to develop a long-term and growing
    learning network with world class partners, and &ndash; on its turn &ndash; share
    expertise with others.&nbsp;</p>"

  title: From Open Access to Open Science from the viewpoint of a scholarly publisher
  description: |-
    <p>The open access publishing model led to dramatic changes in the way scientists communicate their results. Open access also challenged the traditional business models of academic publishers that have been maintained for hundreds of years. Open access to article content, however, soon appeared insufficient as far as access to underlying data was concerned. Opening research data came as the logical second stage of this challenge which was soon put on the agenda of scientific communities, funding organisations and governments. Open data, by itself, raised the question how we can re-use data and reproduce research results, how transparent is the peer-review and, more generally, how scientific evaluation is being performed. Over time, these and other similar developments morphed into what we now call "open science" or, in more general terms, transforming research into a primarily collaborative rather than a primarily competitive endeavour.</p>

    <p>The present lecture summarises the key milestones of the movement from open access through open data to open science from the viewpoint of an academic publisher. It is also illustrated by the ARPHA Biodiversity Data Publishing and Dissemination Toolbox (ARPHA-BioDiv) which is a set of standards, guidelines, tools, workflows and journals, developed by Pensoft within its ARPHA Journal Publishing Platform. The history of development of ARPHA-BioDiv largely resembles the evolution of the open access to open science which started with the pre-publication semantic markup of important domain-specific terms and relationships between them, as implemented in 2010 by the ZooKeys open access journal and then followed by others, for example: PhytoKeys, MycoKeys, Nature Conservation, NeoBiota, Journal of Hymenoptera Research, Deutsche Entomologische Zeitschrift, Zoosystematics and Evolution. The next stage of integrated narrative and open data publishing was pioneered in 2013 by the Biodiversity Data Journal and its associated authoring tool, the ARPHA Writing Tool (AWT), launched as the first ever journal publishing workflow that supported the full life cycle of a manuscript, from writing through community peer-review, publication and dissemination within a single, entirely Web- and XML-based, online collaborative platform. The latest stage of open science publishing is demonstrated by the Research Ideas and Outcomes (RIO) journal that publishes all outputs of the research cycle – including project proposals, data, methods, workflows, software, project reports and research articles – together on a single collaborative platform, with the most transparent, open and public peer-review process.</p>

  title: 'Promoting and Nurturing Interactions with Open Access Books: Strategies
    for Publishers and Authors'
  description: |-
    <p>This report explores how publishers and authors can promote, nurture, and facilitate&nbsp;interaction with openly available books. Open access (obviously) opens up scholarship, but it also offers scope to enhance interactions between books, scholars, publishers, resources, librarians, and of course readers. This might take the form of creating communities and conversations around books, of gathering comments and hyperlinks, or of enabling updating, remixing and reusing, translating, modifying, reviewing, versioning, and forking of existing books. Open access, in short can create additional value and new avenues and formats that go beyond openness, by changing how people interact with books. Research shows that making books available in open access enhances discovery and online consultation (Snijder, 2019), but the short outline above makes clear that there is still a lot to be done to stimulate, explore, and practice the full range of book interactions made possible by open access.</p>

    <p>The first part of this report provides a literature overview that identifies the opportunities that digital technologies and enhanced interactions with open access books can provide for scholarship; it outlines some of the main types of interactions around scholarship&mdash;and around and as part of open access books more in particular&mdash;that scholars are involved in; and it showcases some of the experiments within humanities book publishing with reuse and remix; finally it presents some of the main (technological and socio-cultural) inhibitions that have prevented further uptake of these practices. The second part of this report more closely explores the technical dependencies that the introduced interactions and affordances rely upon. Doing so, it outlines and showcases various open source tools, software, technologies, platforms, infrastructures, guidelines and best practices, that lend themselves to being adopted by publishers and authors (or by publishers and authors working in collaboration with each other) to facilitate interaction around their book(s). The third part of this report then summarises the findings of the previous parts and provides recommendations, guidelines, and strategies (again, both socio-cultural and technological) for publishers and authors to further open up their books and collections to community interaction and reuse.</p>

    <p><strong>Who is this Report for?</strong></p>

    <p>The main communities we want to reach with this report are publishers and authors/scholars (or communities of scholars), to explore how they, by experimenting and often just making simple adjustments, can start to open up and stimulate interactions around their books. Where larger (commercial) publishers often have the resources to develop tools and workflows for interaction in-house (and often proprietary), scholar-led publishers, for example, although they have been at the vanguard of more experimental forms of publishing, have indicated that they often lack expertise and familiarity with more experimental forms of publishing and with the tools available to support them (Adema and Stone, 2017). We therefore focus in this report on open source tools and openly and freely available resources and guidelines that can help small-scale and not-for-profit book publishers that cannot afford to build their own custom platforms, to stimulate engagement around books. We also show various examples throughout this report of how publishers, publishing collectives and platforms, authors, and scholarly communities already are stimulating interaction around books in interesting ways and the tools and practices they have adopted to do so.</p>

    <p>This report focuses on interactions with books and on books within the humanities and social sciences in particular. Many of the types of interaction and interactive practices we describe within this report (such as for example open peer review and data mining), are being used and adopted more commonly within the STEM fields (where their uptake is also more widely researched). The humanities (and to a lesser extent the social sciences) in general have lower adoption rates where it concerns these types of practices and also have field specific preferences (as well as prejudices) towards many of these practices, which will be taken into account and further discussed in this report.</p>

    <p><strong>Types of Interaction</strong></p>

    <p>As part of our research we have identified several types of scholarly interaction taking place around books. The first part of this report is structured around some of the more common kinds of interaction that open access books afford: <em>annotations</em>, <em>open peer review</em>, <em>remix and reuse</em>, <em>social scholarship and networked books</em>, and&nbsp;<em>emergent practices</em> (including versioning, forking, and human computer interactions). This report doesn&rsquo;t aim to cover all forms of interaction around books but has chosen to focus on the kinds of interactions that publishers and scholars would be able to promote and recreate with relatively simple adaptations to their workflows, systems, practices, and licensing. Each of the above identified types of interaction around books will be discussed in the next section, including how we can stimulate them and what obstacles currently exist towards their more general implementation. Throughout the next part of this report we will also be providing examples from within humanities book publishing to illustrate the different kinds of interaction.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; ---&nbsp;&nbsp; ---&nbsp;&nbsp; ---&nbsp;&nbsp; ---&nbsp;&nbsp; ---&nbsp;&nbsp; ---</p>

    <p>The report has itself been published in an experimental way. Making use of the advanced versioning functionalities offered by PubPub, we will iteratively update this document over the remainder of the project, thus allowing us to incorporate user feedback and new technological developments.</p>

    <p>Hence, we would be really grateful for constructive feedback from the communities out there who are already experimenting with new forms of interaction. Please don&rsquo;t hesitate to leave comments either <a href="https://doi.org/10.21428/785a6451.2d6f4263">on the PubPub version</a> (account and login required), or get in touch via email at <a href="wp6@copim.ac.uk">wp6@copim.ac.uk</a></p>

    <p>The report is published as a PDF here on Zenodo, while a more interactive book version that is available <a href="https://doi.org/10.21428/785a6451.2d6f4263">as a PubPub book</a>.</p>

  title: 'Open Science and Radical Solutions for Diversity, Equity and Quality in
    Research: A Literature Review of Different Research Schools, Philosophies and
    Frameworks and Their Potential Impact on Science and Education'
  description: <p>Open Science is a phenomenon that can be traced back to the Middle
    Ages. In the end of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st century, Open
    Science is strongly growing due to the worldwide internet and related new technologies,
    tools and communication channels. Two core objectives (reliability and trust)
    and three main characteristics (transparency, openness and reproducibility) of
    Open Science can be identified but it is still too early for a broad definition
    of this growing movement. Its growth is happening in many disciplines and in diverse
    facets. This article presents an overview how Open Science is introduced and established
    in all three science dimensions of research design, processes and publications.
    For the future, the benefits are analysed that Open Science is offering as well
    as the challenges that it is facing. It can be concluded that it is desirable
    that all researchers collaborate in Open Science. Open Science can improve the
    different science disciplines, research practices and science in general. In that
    way, Open Science can contribute to overcome the post-truth age through increasing
    objective and subjective credibility of science and research. And in the long-term
    perspective, Open Science can improve the whole research, education as well as
    our society.</p>

  title: 'The project EcoNAOS: vision and practice towards an open approach in the
    Northern Adriatic Sea ecological observatory'
  description: |-
    <p>The Open Science approach delineates high and inspiring principles. In order to really root them into the scientific community, a cultural shift must occur that can be fostered and achieved mainly through the development of practical case studies. This is particularly relevant in the field of ecology, a highly multidisciplinary science, where the Open Science issue has become a matter of discussion only in very recent years. In particular, in the context of long-term ecological research, enabling open sharing of in-situ and derived long-term ecological data is required to advance research and education in the European and global networks.</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">The creation of marine ecological observatories, able to arrange and maintain integrated, harmonized and coherent long-term ecological observations, is stressed as a relevant step at the European level, for sustaining European marine policies. The Italian national flagship project RITMARE ("Italian research for the sea", http://www.ritmare.it/en/) fostered the development of a marine ecological observatory in the Northern Adriatic Sea (NAS), one of the 25 research parent sites belonging to the Italian Long-Term Ecological Research Network (LTER-Italy, http://www.lteritalia.it), through a dedicated research line. Within this context, we developed a specific task, aimed at testing and applying the Open Science approach to the NAS ecological observatory: "EcoNAOS - Ecological Northern Adriatic Open Science Observatory System". We present our plans and ideas for the application of the Open Science principles, starting from the 50-year ecological dataset of plankton and related biogeochemical parameters collected in the NAS, mainly in the Gulf of Venice. We introduce each of the different steps needed for "opening science": research ideas statement, raw data collection, data harmonization (structural, syntactic and semantic), ancillary data collection/recovery and metadatation, data and metadata publication, software publication, publication of results, and data citation. In order to share different expertise and include different points of view as essential outcomes themselves, researchers from the field of LTER and data management were involved in EcoNAOS since its start. Our final goal is to demonstrate that a change of vision is possible, leading from "publishing ASAP" to "sharing data and information and collaborating ASAP".</p>

  title: 'Workshop Report: OCSDNet Imagining a Feminist Open Science'
  description: <p>The Open and Collaborative Science in Development Network (OCSDNet),
    funded by IDRC and DFID from 2014-2017, had the key objective of gathering evidence
    to better understand how and whether an open and collaborative approach to scientific
    knowledge production could contribute to development outcomes across a variety
    of social, economic and political contexts. As OCSDNet began to develop a more
    comprehensive framework of OCS, we came to realize that much of the groundwork
    looking at inclusive science practices and theory has been laid by other scholars
    in a variety of fields, especially feminist postcolonial technoscience scholars.
    With OCSDNet coming to a close in its current configuration, it was timely to
    bring a small subset of scholars and practitioners together to discuss what can
    be set in motion through situated feminist open science projects in diverse global
    contexts. The following report highlights the proceedings of the two-day workshop
    which took place from June 20-21 immediately preceding the <a href="http://epress.utsc.utoronto.ca/elpub2018/">Electronic

  title: International, Scholar-led Collaboration around Community-led Open Publishing
    Infrastructures for Monographs
  description: '<p>In this presentation, we will share an overview of an international,
    multi-institutional, 3-year project focused on building Community-led Open Publishing
    Infrastructures for Monographs (COPIM), recently funded for &pound;3.5 million
    by Research England, the Arcadia Fund (UK), and the partners: Birkbeck, University
    of London, Coventry University, the Digital Preservation Coalition, Jisc, Lancaster
    University, Loughborough University Library, ScholarLed, and University of California,
    Santa Barbara (UCSB) Library. COPIM comprises 6 &ldquo;work projects&rdquo; that
    are rooted in the firm conviction that, in order for open access publishing initiatives
    to thrive, we have to develop more robust definitions of &ldquo;open&rdquo; that
    go beyond releasing content from behind paywalls. It pilots a range of interventions,
    from developing open, transparent, sustainable, and community-governed infrastructures
    for the curation, dissemination, discovery, and long-term preservation of open
    content and open data, to following the best practices for integrating open content
    into institutional library, digital learning, and repository systems, as well
    as devising new revenue models for sustaining OA book publishing at various scales.
    ScholarLed believes it is vital to ensure that the mechanisms used by OA publishers
    are driven by, and responsive to, the varied needs of an international scholarly
    community, and a key aspect of COPIM is that it privileges close working relationships
    between publishers, librarians, and other knowledge managers.</p>'

  title: 'Reviewing Reviewers: An innovative tool for improving quality of local Diamond
    Open Access Journals'
  description: "<p><a href=\"http://scindeks.ceon.rs/default.aspx?lang=en\">Serbian
    Citation Index &ndash; SCIndeks</a>&nbsp;is a hybrid Open Access platform based
    on a business model of partnership between a non-profit web publisher and journal
    owners. Most journals hosted by SCIndeks are local scholar-led Diamond OA journals,
    relying on limited financial means, staff, and skills, but highly motivated by
    national regulatory and financing bodies to reach international status and level
    of excellence. The role of SCIndeks as a platform and its development team is
    to assist journals in their efforts by providing them with a journal management
    system, publishing expert guidance, techniques of promotion of journals on web,
    tools intended for quality control, and, finally, precise feedback on their advancement
    within all those processes. One of the most important forms of assistance is the
    comprehensive support for quality peer review.</p>\n\n<p>SCIndeks development
    team uses various strategies and mechanisms to support the peer-review process:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>SCIndeks
    customized OJS-based journal management system (<a href=\"https://aseestant.ceon.rs/\">SCIndeks
    Assistant</a>) helps editors keep track of the peer-review process;</li>\n\t<li>specialized,
    mostly custom-made tools and procedures make it easier for editors and reviewers
    to assess manuscripts: automated identification of mismatched/missing citations
    and references, references to retracted articles, and articles originating from
    disputable journals in the list of references;</li>\n\t<li>training for editors
    and reviewers;</li>\n\t<li>specialized software tool dubbed Reviewing Reviewers
    (RR) enabling the assessment of the usefulness of peer review reports for both
    (a) editorial decisions and (b) for authors&rsquo; improvement of submitted manuscripts;
    while the former is rated by editors, the latter is assessed by the authors themselves,
    which makes RR an innovative and (at the beginning) disputed tool;</li>\n\t<li>Statistics
    module of RR which is also integrated in the SCIndeks journal management system
    accumulating results (grades) of reviewers working for different journals; Statistic
    module is providing ranking of reviewers based on a composite score combining
    editors and authors grades.</li>\n\t<li>The RR composite score is used for selecting
    best reviewers for further engagement and at the same time for selecting candidates
    for annual financial award provided by SCIndeks publisher.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In
    this presentation we describe RR in greater detail and analyze quantitatively
    the effects of its use in two previous years in comparison to the period preceding
    its implementation in SCIndeks Assistant. The analysis shows that the assessment
    of reviewers by the authors has resulted in some changes in reviewers&rsquo; behaviour.
    The change was found on the following indicators: (1) the share of reviews containing
    comments to the authors, (2) the share of such comments containing attachments
    (3) the average number of words in attachments, and (4) the relative number of
    new, first-time peer reviewers. All changes are statistically significant. Opposite
    to the expectations, no changes were observed in the average number of words in
    comments and the average rates given to the reviewers by editorial boards. However,
    what is most indicative, the structure of reviewers&rsquo; recommendations has
    slightly altered. Reviewers now tend to suggest accepting manuscripts conditionally
    (&ldquo;accept after revision&rdquo;) more frequently than before. The increase
    happened at the expense of the number of decisions to accept manuscripts immediately
    (&ldquo;no revision&rdquo;). This may be regarded a sort of proof that reviewers
    have started to take more helpful general attitude toward authors, which is exactly
    what we have sought to achieve.</p>\n\n<p>To conclude, the results, supported
    by some anecdotal evidence, fully encourage the use of RR in an academic environment
    marked by an unsatisfactory reviewing process and the lack of motivation among
    eminent researchers to accept invitations of local journals editors. It is reasonable
    to assume that this will lead to the higher level of article quality in local
    Diamond OA journals, which is the ultimate goal of introducing RR.</p>"

  title: Impact of integrating OER in teacher education at the Open University of
    Sri Lanka
  description: |-
    <p>This chapter reports on a research project implemented in the Faculty of Education at the Open University of Sri Lanka (OUSL) which investigated the impact of integrating Open Educational Resources (OER) in the teaching-learning process by secondary level student teachers in Sri Lanka. The research questions this study seeks to answer are: What are the impacts of OER integration on the use of instructional materials by teachers? What are the impacts of OER integration on teachers&rsquo; pedagogical perspectives? What are the impacts of OER integration on teachers&rsquo; pedagogical practices?</p>

    <p>The study adopted a design-based research approach. An intervention programme was implemented with 230 participants who were student teachers registered in the OUSL Postgraduate Diploma in Education programme in nine OUSL centres across the nine provinces of Sri Lanka. Data were collected at multiple stages through the following quantitative and qualitative strategies: survey questionnaires, analysis of lesson plans, concept mapping, self-reflection, semi-structured interviews, focus group discussions, usage data from the learning management system and narratives in the form of &ldquo;stories&rdquo;. While descriptive statistical methods such as percentages were used to analyse the quantitative data, the authors employed an Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis approach to analyse the qualitative data.</p>

    <p>Findings showed that the integration of OER had a substantial impact on changing teachers&rsquo; instructional resource use, pedagogical perspectives and pedagogical practices. The careful and systematic design of activities facilitated a shift from a &ldquo;low&rdquo; to a &ldquo;high&rdquo; degree of innovative use of instructional resources as well as creation of OER by teachers, while their pedagogical perspectives and practices shifted towards more constructivist, context-centric and collaborative patterns, as well as to a participatory and sharing culture, in favour of Open Educational Practices.</p>

    <p>This kind of capacity-building of teachers in the adoption of OER has the potential to strengthen the school education system in Sri Lanka. Motivating teachers through provision of further opportunities, and recognition of their initiatives through incentives and appreciation, would enhance empowerment of teachers to act as &ldquo;change agents&rdquo;. It will also provide insights to inform recommendations for the formulation of evidence-based guidelines to support OER adoption.</p>

  title: '''Is the library open?'': Correlating unaffiliated access to academic libraries
    with open access support'
  description: <p>In the context of a growing international focus on open access publishing
    options and mandates, this paper explores the extent to which the ideals of &lsquo;openness&rsquo;
    are also being applied to physical knowledge resources and research spaces. This
    study, which forms part of the larger Curtin Open Knowledge Initiative project,
    investigates the relationship between academic library access policies and institutional
    positions on open access or open science publishing. Analysis of library access
    policies and related documents from twenty academic institutions in Asia, Australia,
    Europe, North America, Africa and the United Kingdom shows that physical access
    to libraries for members of the public who are not affiliated with a university
    is often the most restricted category of access. Many libraries impose financial
    and sometimes security barriers on entry to buildings, limiting access to collections
    in print and other non-digital formats. The limits placed on physical access to
    libraries contrast strongly with the central role that these institutions play
    in facilitating open access in digital form for research outputs through institutional
    repositories and open access publishing policies. We compared library access policies
    and practices with open access publishing and research sharing policies for the
    same institutions and found limited correlation between both sets of policies.
    Comparing the two assessments using Spearman&rsquo;s rank correlation coefficient
    confirmed open access policies have a direct association with the narrow aspects
    of public access provided through online availability of formal publications,
    but are not necessarily associated (in the universities in this study) with delivering
    on a broader commitment to public access to knowledge. The results suggest that
    while institutional mission statements and academic library policies may refer
    to sharing of knowledge and research and community collaboration, multiple layers
    of library user categories, levels of privilege and fees charged can inhibit the
    realisation of these goals. As open access publishing options and mandates expand,
    physical entry to academic libraries and access to print and electronic resources
    has contracted. This varies within and across countries, but it conflicts with
    global library and information commitments to open access to knowledge.</p>

  title: 'Beyond Open Access mandates: institutional repositories as building blocks
    in open scholarly communication'
  description: "<p><strong>Aim</strong><br>\nThe presentation traces the emerging
    roles of institutional repositories in Serbia, beyond the main task required by
    the national Open Science (OS) policy (adopted in 2018): to serve as Green Open
    Access (OA) venues.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Background</strong><br>\nAt the time when
    the national OS policy was adopted (2018), Serbia had already had a developed
    network of Diamond OA journals and a national repository of PhD theses, but there
    were only a few fully functional institutional repositories. To comply with the
    policy, which mandates Open Access to publications, research organizations have
    undertaken to establish institutional repositories, without dedicated financial
    support from public funders. Almost three years later, there are around 40 repositories
    and their content goes beyond the policy requirements.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Methods</strong><br>\nThe
    presence of content types not covered by the OA mandate (posters, images, research
    data, etc.) and the coverage of content from the period preceding the adoption
    of the OA mandate are taken as the quantitative indicators of the emerging roles
    for institutional repositories in Serbia. We analyze content types in around 40
    institutional repositories based on data provided by repositories and aggregators.
    A qualitative analysis based on a survey conducted among repository managers is
    also presented. Finally, as the authors are also members of a repository development
    team, a brief overview of measures taken towards supporting the emerging roles
    of institutional repositories is given.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Results and discussion</strong><br>\nThe
    results show that although most institutional repositories in Serbia were established
    with the aim of ensuring compliance with the OA mandate, research organizations
    have assigned them other roles, namely:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>to serve as comprehensive
    digital libraries of the institution&rsquo;s research outputs as, far back in
    history as possible, no matter whether the content is OA or not;</li>\n\t<li>to
    serve as a source of information in various reporting procedures (annual reports,
    promotion procedures, etc.);</li>\n\t<li>to showcase the institution&rsquo;s publishing
    activity;</li>\n\t<li>to make print-only publications, especially monographs,
    available in a digital environment;</li>\n\t<li>to showcase various non-publication
    outputs (technical reports, posters, promotional materials, students&rsquo; works,
    etc.)</li>\n\t<li>to serve as research data repositories.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>One
    of the most important incentives for this is the high visibility of local repositories
    and their content in international aggregators, discovery platforms (OpenAIRE,
    BASE, CORE), and search engines (Google Scholar). There is an apparent tendency
    to make content open whenever possible. Interestingly, institutional repositories
    in Serbia are still not used for sharing Open Education Resources and training
    materials.</p>\n\n<p>The initiative to increase content diversity in an institutional
    repository usually comes either from institutional decision-makers or from librarians.
    Whether an innovative idea in this direction will be realized or not largely depends
    on the readiness of repository development teams and librarians to support it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br>\nIn
    most cases, once an institution decides to invest in a repository, it wants to
    make the best use of it, especially if its functionalities can make up for some
    missing links in the local infrastructure for scholarly communication (e.g. book
    publishing platforms or CRIS). Our analysis shows that institutional repositories
    can successfully meet various innovative needs and serve as crucial building blocks
    of open scholarly communication if appropriate support from repository developers
    and librarians is provided. Furthermore, training related to repositories and
    researchers&rsquo; involvement with this type of infrastructure contribute to
    the development of skills relevant for Open Science and scholarly communication.
    The fact that innovative initiatives come from within institutions, without any
    pressure from research funders, indicates that there is an intrinsic interest
    in open scholarly communication. On the other hand, the lack of incentives from
    the responsible ministry may be discouraging in the long term.</p>"

  title: 'Foundations towards the future: FutPrInt50 TLARs an open approach'
  description: <p>A hybrid-electric regional aircraft for 50 passengers has challenges
    in technology, operation and future regulations similar to larger class aircraft.
    It is thus at the right spot to drive technology, regulations and operational
    developments in order to accelerate cleaner flight technologies based on propulsion
    electrification. The FUTPRINT50 team set up Top-Level Aircraft Requirements that
    aim to be a reference foundation for the development of specific topics handled
    in this H2020 project but also drive the open collaboration model adopted by FUTPRINT50.
    In this paper the development of the mission statement will be explained for a
    hybrid-electric 50 passenger regional aircraft, which builds the framework for
    the Top-Level Aircraft Requirements. To further support development from these
    requirements, a mission scenario will be presented for this class of aircraft.</p>

  title: 'ENES Data Space: an open, cloud-enabled data science environment for climate
    analysis'
  description: |-
    <p>Presentation delivered at EGU 2022 (Vienna, Austria):</p>

    <p>The scientific discovery process has been deeply influenced by the data deluge started at the beginning of this century. This has caused a profound transformation in several scientific domains which are now moving towards much more collaborative processes.</p>

    <p>In the climate sciences domain, the ENES Data Space aims to provide an open, scalable, cloud-enabled data science environment for climate data analysis. It represents a collaborative research environment, deployed on top of the EGI federated cloud infrastructure, specifically designed to address the needs of the ENES community. The service, developed in the context of the EGI-ACE project, provides ready-to-use compute resources and datasets, as well as a rich ecosystem of open source Python modules and community-based tools (e.g., CDO, Ophidia, Xarray, Cartopy, etc.), all made available through the user-friendly Jupyter interface.</p>

    <p>In particular, the ENES Data Space provides access to a multi-terabyte set of specific variable-centric collections from large community experiments to support researchers in climate model data analysis experiments. The data pool of the ENES Data Space consists of a mirrored subset of CMIP datasets from the ESGF federated data archive collected by using the Synda community tool<br>
    in order to provide the most up to date datasets into a single location. Results and output products as well as experiment definitions (in the form of Jupyter Notebooks) can be easily shared among users through data sharing services, which are also being integrated in the infrastructure, such as EGI DataHub.</p>

    <p>The service was opened in the second part of 2021 and is now accessible in the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) through the EOSC Portal Marketplace (https://marketplace.eoscportal.eu/services/enes-data-space). This contribution will present an overview of the ENES Data Space service and its main features.</p>

  title: Seven Guiding Principles for Open Research Information
  description: |-
    <p>This document lists seven Guiding Principles for research organisations to adopt in when creating and procuring services to manage research information.</p>

    <p>In particular, the Guiding Principles as formulated in this document aim to help:</p>

    <p>1. guide academic institutions with decisions in information management of research in their organisations;</p>

    <p>2. form a collective frame in which academic institutions jointly formulate policy and steer investments in infrastructure;</p>

    <p>3. provide clear rules of engagement for collaborations involving publicly funded academic data and metadata.</p>

    <p>This document is developed by the Dutch Taskforce on Responsible Management of Research Information and Data.36 This Taskforce was established early 2020 by the Association of Universities in the Netherlands (UNL), The Netherlands Federation of University Medical Centres (NFU) and The Dutch Research Council (NWO) to address issues around the responsible use of research information and the role of commercial third party providers in particular.</p>

  title: Building  communities of practice around environmental open data science
  description: '<p>Environmental scientists are a diverse community that ranges from
    climatologists to geneticists, but we are united by an enormous need to work efficiently
    with data &ndash; and by the fact that we seldom have formal computing or data
    analysis training of any kind. There is great opportunity to borrow from the work
    of software engineers and use collaborative open tools that facilitate better
    science in less time. However, a fundamental shift is needed in the environmental
    science community that prioritizes data science and provides emerging scientific
    leaders training in open science tools and practices to strengthen and accelerate
    their work. I will discuss my work to catalyze this shift through two programs
    I have developed and lead at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis
    (NCEAS) at the University of California at Santa Barbara. The first is the Ocean
    Health Index training program, which teaches international government and academic
    scientists how to channel the best available scientific information into marine
    policy using our scientific method and tools. And the second I have recently launched
    in January 2019 as a Mozilla Fellow: Openscapes, a mentorship program that empowers
    environmental scientists with open data science tools and grows the community
    of practice.</p>'

  title: 'Pre-Commercial Procurement: R&D as a Service for the European Open Science
    Cloud'
  description: The use of commercial cloud services has gained popularity in research
    environments. Not only it is a flexible solution for adapting computing capacity
    to the researchers' needs, it also provides access to the newest functionalities
    on the market. In addition, most service providers offer cloud credits, enabling
    researchers to explore innovative architectures before procuring them at scale.
    Yet, the economical and contractual aspects linked to the production use of commercial
    clouds are often overlooked, preventing researchers to reap their full benefits.    CERN,
    in collaboration with leading European research institutes, has launched several
    initiatives to bridge this gap. Completed in 2018, the HNSciCloud Pre-Commercial
    Procurement (PCP) project successfully developed a European hybrid cloud platform
    to pioneer the convergence and deployment of commercial cloud, high-performance
    computing and big-data capabilities for scientific research. Leveraging many of
    the lessons learned from HNSciCloud, the OCRE project - Open Clouds for Research
    Environments - started in January 2019 in order to accelerate commercial cloud
    adoption in the European research community. In parallel, the ARCHIVER PCP project
    - Archiving and Preservation for Research Environments - will develop hybrid and
    scalable solutions for archiving and long-term preservation of scientific data
    whilst ensuring that research groups retain stewardship of their datasets.     With
    a total procurement budget exceeding €18 million, these initiatives are setting
    best practices for effective and sustainable procurement of commercial cloud services
    for research activities. These are highly relevant as, in the wider context of
    the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC), the engagement of commercial providers
    is considered fundamental  to contribute to the creation of a sustainable, technologically
    advanced environment with open services for data management, analysis and re-use
    across disciplines, with transparent costing models.    In this contribution,
    we will detail the outcomes of the HNSciCloud PCP project, expand on the objectives
    of the subsequent OCRE and ARCHIVER projects and provide a vision for the role
    of the private sector within the EOSC.

  description: |-
    <p>A &gt; A0 poster which is designed for fabric print and can be&nbsp;cut and sewed into two T-Shirts.</p>

    <p>This&nbsp;project has received the OHBM best abstract merit award. The poster was presented at the 2017&nbsp;Annual Meeting of the Organization for Human Brain Mapping (OHBM) in Vancouver, 25&ndash;29&nbsp;June.</p>

    <p>Project:</p>

    <p>Significant investment has been made into collecting and sharing brain imaging data for thousands of individuals. One key challenge, however, limits the usability of this data: To work with it, researchers need to download the data locally; and curation, editing and analysis are then done redundantly by each research group. This painstaking process results in a large proportion of shared data not being analysed, wasting time and funding.</p>

    <p>With the Open Neuroimaging Laboratory, we solve this challenge by creating an opensource Web framework that provides direct access to this wealth of data, and allows people to perform analyses collaboratively, using only a browser. With its two first applications &ndash; BrainBox1 and MetaSearch2 &ndash; the OpenNeuroLab facilitates finding, improving, and reusing the massive amount of brain MRI data available online. By requiring nothing but a Web browser, our virtual neuroimaging laboratory lowers the barriers for researchers, students, and citizen scientists to help scientific discovery.</p>

  title: e-Service Innovation within Open Innovation Networks
  description: |-
    Service innovations are central concerns in fast
    changing environment. Due to the fitness in customer demands and
    advances in information technologies (IT) in service management, an
    expanded conceptualization of e-service innovation is required.
    Specially, innovation practices have become increasingly more
    challenging, driving managers to employ a different open innovation
    model to maintain competitive advantages. At the same time, firms
    need to interact with external and internal customers in innovative
    environments, like the open innovation networks, to co-create values.
    Based on these issues, an important conceptual framework of e-service
    innovation is developed. This paper aims to examine the contributing
    factors on e-service innovation and firm performance, including
    financial and non-financial aspects. The study concludes by showing
    how e-service innovation will play a significant role in growing the
    overall values of the firm. The discussion and conclusion will lead to a
    stronger understanding of e-service innovation and co-creating values
    with customers within open innovation networks.

  title: KOALA - Establishing Consortial Open Access Solutions
  description: |-
    <p>In the KOALA (Konsortiale Open-Access-L&ouml;sungen aufbauen) project, consortial solutions for financing open access publications are being established. Collaborative funding of open access journals and book series by academic libraries is an alternative to the dominant model, in which articles are paid for individually by authors or their institutions through APC (article processing charges). During the project period from April 2021 to March 2023, the TIB &ndash; Leibniz Information Centre for Science and Technology will work with the Communication, Information, Media Centre (KIM) of the University of Konstanz to establish at least one such consortium as a funding partner for open access periodicals. The project is funded by the German Ministry of Education and Research.<br>
    Within the project framework, further analyses will be carried out and conversions of periodicals to open access will be accompanied. In addition, a central helpdesk for editors who need help with the transition to open access or with finding sustainable funding will be created. The infrastructure created by KOALA enables fair and sustainable financing of quality-assured open access publications. It contributes to removing financial hurdles for authors and thus facilitates participation in open access publications.<br>
    The conference poster will outline the purpose and central objectives of KOALA, as well as describing the key points for the perspective of libraries, editors and publishers. For our initial exploration of their perspectives, we are seeking active involvement from these stakeholders and will be entering into a dialogue with them.<br>
    For the poster&rsquo;s visualisation, we will draw on the image of a koala&rsquo;s natural habitat: the key points and objectives of the project will be illustrated against the backdrop of a eucalyptus tree.</p>

  title: MAgPIE 4 - a modular open-source framework for modeling global land systems
  description: '<p>The open-source modeling framework MAgPIE (Model of Agricultural
    Production and its Impact on the Environment) combines economic and biophysical
    approaches to simulate spatially explicit global scenarios of land use within
    the 21st century and the respective interactions with the environment. Besides
    various other projects, it was used to simulate marker scenarios of the Shared
    Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) and contributed substantially to multiple IPCC assessments.
    However, with growing scope and detail, the non-linear model has become increasingly
    complex, computationally intensive and non-transparent, requiring structured approaches
    to improve the development and evaluation of the model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here,
    we provide an overview on version 4 of MAgPIE and how it addresses these issues
    of increasing complexity using new technical features: modular structure with
    exchangeable module implementations, flexible spatial resolution, in-code documentation,
    automatized code checking, model/output evaluation and open accessibility. Application
    examples provide insights into model evaluation, modular flexibility and region-specific
    analysis approaches. While this paper is focused on the general framework as such,
    the publication is accompanied by a detailed model documentation describing contents
    and equations, and by model evaluation documents giving insights into model performance
    for a broad range of variables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the open-source release
    of the MAgPIE 4 framework, we hope to contribute to more transparent, reproducible
    and collaborative research in the field. Due to its modularity and spatial flexibility,
    it should provide a basis for a broad range of land-related research with economic
    or biophysical, global or regional focus.</p>'

    between libraries, Citizen Science and Open (Cultural) Data.<br>\nNext, Peter
    Kraker and Beate Guba discuss Open Knowledge Maps in order to present a novel
    model that connects them back to library systems and makes it possible to add
    custom visual discovery services to their offerings. Open Knowledge Maps attempt
    to transform discovery of scientific knowledge by providing an open, visual, and
    community-driven system that is based on Open Infrastructure. They provide an
    instant overview of a field by showing its main areas at a glance and papers related
    to each area. Based on this idea, in the novel model, Open Knowledge Maps acts
    as a cloud, so there is no need to install new software on library servers. The
    presentation explains the workings, and uses, of this tool.<br>\nFinally, a lightning
    talk by Jaime Orr, Heather Saunders, and then Brianne Selman will explore Early
    Career Researcher Day, an inter-university event spearheaded by the University
    of Winnipeg. Attendees considering how to encourage knowledge sharing among early-career
    researchers and between academics and their support staff can learn from the case
    study of this event. The talk will report on the successes and challenges of both
    the inaugural in-person event in 2020 and the 2021 virtual adaptation, which responded
    to the unique challenges of the global pandemic.</p>"

  title: Blue-Cloud poster - EMODnet Open Conference 2021
  description: |-
    <p>The Horizon 2020 Blue-Cloud (B-C) project launched in October 2019, aims to demonstrate the potential of web-based Open Science in the marine domain. To deliver on this objective, B-C is piloting the development of a web-based cyber platform that provides marine scientists with enhanced analytical capabilities. It facilitates their engagement in collaborative research and provides them with access to powerful cloud-computing resources, a range of analytical tools and simplified access to multi-disciplinary data from in situ and satellite-derived observations to model outputs. Blue-Cloud addresses the Innovation Action &ldquo;The Future of Seas and Oceans Flagship Initiative (BG-07-2019-2020)&rdquo; and it is co-designed by, and builds on, existing European capability, including trusted data services (EMODnet, CMEMS) and other key marine data and research infrastructures (SeaDataNet, EurOBIS, Euro-Argo, Argo GDAC, ELIXIR-ENA, EuroBioImaging, and ICOS-Marine) and e-infrastructures (EUDAT, D4Science, WEkEO).</p>

    <p>In particular, Blue-Cloud demonstrators are going to integrate diverse data from EMODnet. For example, biodiversity and environmental data (relevant for the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.blue-cloud.org/demonstrators/plankton-genomics">&lsquo;Plankton Genomics&rsquo; demonstrator</a>), physics, biology, chemistry data (relevant for the <a href="https://www.blue-cloud.org/demonstrators/marine-environmental-indicators">&lsquo;Marine Environmental Indicators&rsquo; demonstrator</a>), biology and coastlines data (relevant for <a href="https://www.blue-cloud.org/demonstrators/fish-matter-scales">&lsquo;Fish, a matter of scales&rsquo; demonstrator</a>), and in-situ environmental data for ground-truthing and European marine topography (relevant for <a href="https://www.blue-cloud.org/demonstrators/aquaculture-monitor">&lsquo;Aquaculture Monitor&rsquo; demonstrator</a>). Moreover, the EMODnet potential is going to be exploited to create a bridge between the Blue-Cloud and the EU-funded projects the consortium has established synergies with (e.g. AQUA-Lit, ENVRI-FAIR).</p>

  title: Un modelo emergente de investigación libre y abierta en educación / Emerging
    model of free and open research in education
  description: |-
    <p><strong>Resumen:</strong> En un escenario en el cual emerge una cr&iacute;tica pol&iacute;tica, &eacute;tica y filos&oacute;fica sobre las pr&aacute;cticas investigadoras en la ciencia actual, esta investigaci&oacute;n problematiza una propuesta de investigaci&oacute;n libre y abierta (ILA) y un modus vivendi investigador comprometido con una ciencia m&aacute;s abierta, inspirado en los principios &eacute;ticos y pr&aacute;cticas de la cultura hacker y la indagaci&oacute;n basada en la comunidad. Siguiendo un planteamiento de autoetnograf&iacute;a colaborativa, se problematizan y relatan acciones y procesos de investigaci&oacute;n educativa desde el punto de vista de tres investigadores militantes, que promueven y participan en proyectos ILA. Basados en el an&aacute;lisis colaborativo de estas actividades de investigaci&oacute;n, se discute una representaci&oacute;n emergente que contiene reflexiones y teoriza seis puntos clave de un modelo de investigaci&oacute;n: a) La filos&oacute;fica-pol&iacute;tica, b) la(s) t&eacute;cnica(s) del entorno de colaboraci&oacute;n, c) el desarrollo neo-conceptual, d) las incertidumbres, movimientos y tensiones e) las capacidades de coordinaci&oacute;n y org&aacute;nica de investigaci&oacute;n con amplia participaci&oacute;n y tambi&eacute;n f) la innovaci&oacute;n disruptiva y contra-hegem&oacute;nica frente a la actual cultura acad&eacute;mica y de investigaci&oacute;n neoliberal. La ILA podr&iacute;a constituirse como un espacio colaborativo de construcci&oacute;n de onto-epistemolog&iacute;as y metodolog&iacute;as contrahegem&oacute;nicas que operen fuera del alcance de los dispositivos de disciplinamiento, vigilancia y control de la actividad investigadora actual.</p>

    <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In a scenario in which political, ethical and philosophical critiques of research practices in current science are emerging, this research problematises a free and open research proposal (ILA), a research modus vivendi committed to a more open science, the ethical principles and practices of hacker culture and community-based enquiry. Following a collaborative autoethnography approach, actions and processes of educational research are problematised and narrated from the point of view of three militant researchers, who promote and participate in ILA projects. Based on the collaborative analysis of these research activities, an emergent representation is discussed that theorises six key points of a research model: a) the philosophical-political, b) the technical(s) of the collaborative environment, c) the neo-conceptual development, d) the uncertainties, movements and tensions, e) the coordinating and organic capacities of research with broad participation and also f) the disruptive and counter-hegemonic innovation in the face of the current neoliberal academic and research culture. The ILA could be established as a collaborative space for the construction of onto-epistemologies and counter-hegemonic methodologies that operate beyond the reach of the disciplinary, surveillance and control devices applied to current research activity.</p>

  title: ON-MERRIT D4.2 Drivers and barriers to uptake of Open Science resources in
    industry
  description: "<p>The deliverable report <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3875017\">D4.1
    - Information Seeking Behaviour and Open Science Uptake in Industry: A Literature
    Review (Fessl et al. 2020)</a> served as the starting point for this deliverable
    report D4.2.</p>\n\n<p>In T4.1 of ON-MERRIT, we conducted an extensive literature
    review on the current state of the art regarding information-seeking behaviour
    in SMEs and industries, as well as the current status of the uptake of Open Science
    resources in this regard. Our findings with regard to T4.1 were reported in D4.1.</p>\n\n<p>Based
    on the insights gained from D4.1, we started our investigation of the uptake of
    responsible research and innovation (RRI) and Open Science in SMEs/industries
    by conducting an interview study in Austria. We then followed up this work with
    a questionnaire study across Europe. Our overall findings show that i) individuals
    with a university education are more familiar with the concept of Open Science
    than others and that ii) Open Science resources already play an important role
    in the companies (of our interview partners), but their uptake depends on the
    company characteristics, including the company&rsquo;s domain, and the products
    and services offered.</p>\n\n<p>From both studies, we identified drivers that
    support the uptake of Open Science resources: i) the employment of people with
    a university background, ii) offering incentives and support for uptake, iii)
    offering targeted training to increase uptake, iv) learning from trans- and interdisciplinary
    cooperations, and v) exploiting the wisdom of the crowd. We also identified the
    following barriers that hinder the uptake of Open Science resources: i) scarcity
    of health-related data, ii) licence restrictions for the commercial use of some
    data sets, iii) the reliability and validation of data, and iv) limited number
    of Open Access publications and expensive fees for publishing Open Access.</p>\n\n<p>Taking
    these drivers and barriers into account, we postulate the following two policy
    recommendations to make scientific results (re)usable in SMEs as well as industries.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Make
    Open Science, its opportunities and benefits more visible, especially outside
    the university context.</li>\n\t<li>Increase the number of Open Access publications
    available for all interested stakeholders, especially in domains with no strong
    tradition in Open Access.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Overall, we found that Open Science
    resources are already used by SMEs and industries. However, there is still a lot
    of work to do to raise awareness of the Open Science endeavours within the private
    sector and to increase benefits from Open Science resources to help spur growth
    and innovation in SMEs and industries.</p>"

  title: 'Helsinki University Open Access Hub Project: Results, Challenges, and Plans'
  description: |-
    <p>Helsinki University Open Access Hub project (2017-2019) was executed in 2017-2019. This poster presents the results, challenges, and plans of designing open access services in the library.</p>

    <p>RESULTS: THE OPEN ACCESS HUB</p>

    <p>During the project, library created several services and work practices:</p>

    <p>1. Practices for publication fee services: article processing charges (APC) and book processing charges (BPC).</p>

    <p>2. Publication platform services: Helda Open Books and Editori, platform for open journals.</p>

    <p>3. Helsinki University Press, open access publisher in co-operation with academic publisher Gaudeamus.</p>

    <p>After the project, there is a need to create criteria and a structured way to evaluate our services, old and new. When we create new services, we need to know, after the pilot stage, which of them should be continued or discontinued, and how to implement project work into normal workflows.</p>

    <p>In this poster, we especially concentrate on the APC fund and Open Access monograph services of the library.</p>

    <p>CHALLENGES AND PLANS</p>

    <p>Traditionally library services have centered on lending and acquiring. Now, library is transforming from a repository to a publisher. Do we understand our new role and its demands? New services call for new resources and skills. Implementation and centralization of open access services to university staff has changed our service structure for our patrons and the workflows inside the library and between internal service units.</p>

    <p>For instance, implementation of Plan S initiative in 2021 demands us to re-evaluate our services and systems. In order to answer to these demands library establishes APC fund. For the first time, library collects subscription expenditure and publication cost data on the university level, for the university reporting and other possible needs (e.g. Ministry of Education, OpenAPC, research funders).</p>

    <p>In the rapidly changing field of Open Access, how can we define the open access services evaluation criteria? How can we measure the importance and return of invest (ROI) of the developed services? How do we justify our decisions to our patrons and our alma mater? Do we have the necessary courage to stop doing something?</p>

    <p>Library is collecting data of the publishing culture in the University of Helsinki: both financial data of APCs and BPCs and publication data, such as evaluative information (e.g. Finnish Publication Forum classification). We gather information of publications trends, e.g. which publication channels our researchers use. We investigate the possibilities and sustainability of emerging new open access initiatives and collaborative models.</p>

    <p>We follow the impact and visibility of Open Access monographs published by University of Helsinki&rsquo;s authors and aim to create a model for this (Helda Open Books, Helsinki University Press books and the other Open Access monographs, which are funded by library). One of our aims is to follow up the usage and societal impact of those Open Access articles, for which library has paid the Open Access publication fees.</p>

  title: 'ArXiv in the open access era : it''s use and Impact on  physics researches'
  description: <p>ArXiv is an Open Access (OA) e-prints repository of physics, mathematics
    computer science, and related subjects. The purpose of this study is to determine
    the use and impact of arXiv on physics researchers of selected research institutes
    in Bengaluru, India. The study was conducted using the survey method, and a structured
    questionnaire was distributed to physics researchers working in five research
    institutions in Bengaluru. The first part of the questionnaire consists of demographic
    information second part consists of the usage of arXiv, and the last section includes
    the impact of usage and satisfaction level of users. The response was 73%, and
    analysis revealed that 94% of the respondents use arXiv. The study showed that
    more than 50% contribute to arXiv and that they are highly satisfied with the
    use of this resource. Further, the study has also shown that, by contributing
    to arXiv, the researchers benefited from significant impacts, such as getting
    good feedback, collaborations, and an increase in the number of citations. We
    believe that this study will encourage researchers to use and contribute to OA
    resources and also motivate libraries to promote OA repositories.</p>

  title: 'From insight network to open policy practice: practical experiences'
  description: '<p><strong>Background: </strong>Evidence-informed decision-making
    and better use of scientific information in societal decisions has been an area
    of development for decades but is still topical. Decision support work can be
    viewed from the perspective of information collection, synthesis and flow between
    decision-makers, experts and stakeholders. Open policy practice is a coherent
    set of methods for such work. It has been developed and utilised mostly in Finnish
    and European contexts.</p><p><strong>Methods: </strong>An overview of open policy
    practice is given, and theoretical and practical properties are evaluated based
    on properties of good policy support. The evaluation is based on information from
    several assessments and research projects developing and applying open policy
    practice and the authors'' practical experiences. The methods are evaluated against
    their capability of producing quality of content, applicability and efficiency
    in policy support as well as how well they support close interaction among participants
    and understanding of each other''s views.</p><p><strong>Results: </strong>The
    evaluation revealed that methods and online tools work as expected, as demonstrated
    by the assessments and policy support processes conducted. The approach improves
    the availability of information and especially of relevant details. Experts are
    ambivalent about the acceptability of openness – it is an important scientific
    principle, but it goes against many current research and decision-making practices.
    However, co-creation and openness are megatrends that are changing science, decision-making
    and the society at large. Against many experts'' fears, open participation has
    not caused problems in performing high-quality assessments. On the contrary, a
    key challenge is to motivate and help more experts, decision-makers and citizens
    to participate and share their views. Many methods within open policy practice
    have also been widely used in other contexts.</p><p><strong>Conclusions: </strong>Open
    policy practice proved to be a useful and coherent set of methods. It guided policy
    processes toward a more collaborative approach, whose purpose was wider understanding
    rather than winning a debate. There is potential for merging open policy practice
    with other open science and open decision process tools. Active facilitation,
    community building and improving the user-friendliness of the tools were identified
    as key solutions for improving the usability of the method in the future.</p>'

  title: Toward a Spanish SKA Regional Centre fully engaged with open science
  description: <p>The Square Kilometre Array Observatory (SKAO) will build the most
    sensitive radio telescopes on Earth. To address fundamental questions in astrophysics,
    fundamental physics, and astrobiology, it will require processing and handling
    complex and extremely massive data close to the exascale, hence constituting a
    technological challenge for the next decade. Approximately 600 Peta-bytes (PB)
    of calibrated data will be delivered to the network of SKA Regional Centers (SRCs)
    worldwide. As a world-leading scientific instrument, SKAO aims to pursue the best
    practices in scientific methodology. Remarkably, it includes the reproducibility
    of its data as a metric of success. We present the Spanish prototype of an SRC
    (SPSRC), which supports preparatory scientific activities for the future SKA projects.
    These include science with SKA precursors and pathfinders while promoting Open
    Science practices as a way to enable scientific reproducibility. We describe the
    key developments and components of the SPSRC that align with these objectives.
    In particular, we describe the performed work on hardware and cloud computing
    infrastructure, science archive, software and services, user support and training,
    and collaboration with other SRCs. The resulting SPSRC platform is flexible enough
    to host heterogeneous projects while being scalable toward the demanding SKA requirements.</p>

  title: Brokerage Event Towards a FAIR Compliant Commons in the ASREN Region (Open
    Repositories 2021 Workshop) - Agenda with links to slides
  description: |-
    <p>This file is the agenda for the Brokerage Event towards a FAIR compliant Commons in the ASREN Region. Within the agenda there are links to all slides (which are hosted in a repository).</p>

    <p>National Research and Education Networks (NRENs) in Africa are organised under three umbrella Regional Research and Education Networks (RRENs), namely&nbsp;<a href="https://asrenorg.net/">ASREN</a>&nbsp;in the northern part of the continent as well as in the Middle-East and the Persian Gulf Region,&nbsp;<a href="http://https//wacren.net/">WACREN</a>&nbsp;in the western part of sub-Saharan Africa and the&nbsp;<a href="https://ubuntunet.net/">UbuntuNet Alliance</a>&nbsp;in the eastern part of sub-Saharan Africa.<br>
    All African RRENs are very much committed not only to increase and capillarize connectivity among countries across the continent but also, and more importantly in the long term, to create a portfolio of services that could help and improve the collaboration between African researchers and their colleagues in the rest of the world, bridging the gaps in openness of research&nbsp;and visibility of research outputs. In this respect, the support of the European Union, through large projects like&nbsp;<a href="https://africaconnect3.net/">AfricaConnect3</a>, and initiatives like&nbsp;<a href="https://spaces.wacren.net/display/LIBSENSE">LIBSENSE</a>, in the area of digital repositories and Open Science more at large, play key roles.</p>

    <p>This event, which is part of the programme of the&nbsp;<a href="https://or2021.openrepositories.org/">16th International Conference on Open Repositories</a>&nbsp;(OR2021), frames itself in this landscape of actions and aims at promoting&nbsp;<a href="https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/">FAIR principles</a>&nbsp;compliant commons such as digital repositories and persistent identifiers for both researchers and their research outputs. However, what makes this event different&nbsp;from similar ones&nbsp;is its innovative co-creation methodology. We aim at bringing in the same virtual place solution seekers, solution providers, policy makers and end users to trigger new collaborations and we propose a &ldquo;try before you buy&rdquo; approach.</p>

  title: 'Toward the broader globalization of Open Source: documenting your localisation
    Journey'
  description: |-
    <p>The Turing Way is an open-source community-led guide to reproducible, ethical and inclusive data science. Its goal is to provide all the information that researchers, industry professionals and members of the public need to understand reproducibility and ethical standards in data science at all stages of development. The Turing Way contains chapters with best practices, guidance and recommendations that are crowdsourced, collaboratively documented and used internationally by researchers from across the globe.</p>

    <p>The Turing Way community currently hosts over 200 sub-chapters across five guides and over 300 direct contributors on GitHub, where we develop our resources that are used by thousands of geographically and culturally diverse users. However, the guide is written in English. This language barrier motivated us to create community-led, multilingual versions of The Turing Way, with the same collaborative spirit that permeates the main guide. The community then started working collaboratively on translations of the Turing Way material to several languages, including Spanish, Arabic and Turkish, while trying out different platforms (such as Transifex and Crowdin).</p>

    <p>Eventually, we established a workflow in Crowdin for the translation, which is a key step for internationalisation (i18n) of The Turing Way. Localisation (l10n) and internationalisation (i18n) are important aspects in the design of any open-source project or document. Internationalisation allows open-source projects to support and satisfy the needs of multiple locales, thus &ldquo;enabling&rdquo; localisation, which is the adaptation of it to meet the language and the culture of a specific target locale.</p>

    <p>However, translation workflows can often become confusing and inconsistent, and many translation efforts go unfinished for several different reasons.<strong> Our aim is to provide clear guidelines, so any potential contributor is able to participate freely while keeping consistency in the translation.</strong> We project clear documentation to facilitate the creation of language bridges that connect to diverse audiences. Therefore, we have documented the translation workflows inside the Community Handbook, which is a part of the Turing Way book. It provides information about all our practices within the project, ways of working, and other aspects that can make community participation equitable for all members. <strong>We also include language-specific documentation in GitHub written by the target language contributors. By structuring and combining the relevant glossaries available in such languages, we enable community members to translate using standardised terminology consistently. </strong>Sharing and documenting our translation journey has proven to be important in reaching out to new members and making their contributions smoother and more accessible.</p>

  title: Afraid of Scooping - Case Study on Researcher Strategies Against Fear of
    Scooping in the Context of Open Science
  description: <p>The risk of scooping is often used as a counter argument for open
    science, especially open data. In this case study I have examined openness strategies,
    practices and attitudes in two open collaboration research projects created by
    Finnish researchers, in order to understand what made them resistant to the fear
    of scooping. The radically open approach of the projects includes open-by-default
    funding proposals, co-authorship and community membership. Primary sources used
    are interviews of the projects founding members. The analysis indicates that openness
    requires trust in close peers, but not necessarily in research community or society
    at large. Focusing on intrinsic goals, such as new knowledge and bringing about
    ethical reform, instead of publications, supports openness. Understanding fundaments
    of science, such as philosophy and science and research ethics can also have a
    beneficial effect. Whether there are aspects in open sharing that makes it seem
    riskier from the point of view of certain demographical groups, such as women,
    could be worth more studying.</p>

  title: Bridging Digital Humanities Internal And Open Source Software Projects Through
    Reusable Building Blocks
  description: |-
    <p>Software development is often an integral aspect of Digital Humanities projects. &nbsp;By working to generalize and build small modules or utilities targeting specific needs rather than large-scale systems, DH software developers have the capacity to generate tools with greater potential for scholarly reuse, which should enable more rapid development on future projects, and allow developers to focus on innovative work. This poster demonstrates a case study of modular software developed as part of ongoing DH projects.</p>

    <p>There is a tendency among some institutions, particularly libraries, to adopt existing large-scale Open Source Software solutions and adapt them for local needs; but as Hector Correa points out, this approach results in skipping the work of thinking carefully about users and local needs (Correa, 2017). &nbsp;If large-scale software solutions developed by coalitions of libraries are problematic (Princeton University Library Systems, 2017) where needs are at least similar, even where content structures or workflows differ, this problem is redoubled for research software, which is much more likely bespoke to a particular problem. &nbsp;As Correa argues, single-purpose software is less complex and easier to understand and manage; and understanding the logic of code is crucial for research that is based on or otherwise makes use of software (Koeser, 2015).</p>

    <p>Applying best practices from software development such as modular design can mitigate these problems through an emphasis on delivering working components of software and focusing on simplicity of purpose&mdash;a single, well-honed and balanced knife rather than a multi-tool with every imaginable attachment. &nbsp;This approach is consistent with the design philosophy from one of the greatest success stories of modern open-source software, UNIX and its derivatives (Raymond, 2003).</p>

    <p>There are certainly possible drawbacks and concerns about this approach. &nbsp;It may require more effort, and perhaps different skills, to create, release, and manage independent software packages or modules. &nbsp;According to Glass&rsquo;&nbsp;Facts and Fallacies of Software Engineering, it is &ldquo;three times as difficult to build reusable components as single use components&rdquo; (Glass, 2003: 49). In our case, when new software modules were being developed and extended in tandem with an existing software project, finalizing a new release of that project involved releasing and publishing multiple software modules. &nbsp;There is also a danger of generalizing too soon; another familiar rule of thumb in software is that you have to do something three times before you know how to generalize it properly (Glass, 2003).</p>

    <p>As a case study, our poster will present an overview of the software written for two annotation projects that were developed at the same time. &ldquo;Derrida&rsquo;s Margins&rdquo; analyzes the work of Jacques Derrida through references in&nbsp;De la grammatologie&nbsp;and corresponding annotations in the books he cited. &ldquo;The Winthrop Family on the Page&rdquo; examines a community of readers connected through books over time via annotations. &nbsp;This software ecosystem includes two project codebases (Koeser et al., 2018; Koeser and Hicks, 2018a) that make use of four new reusable components (Koeser and Hicks, 2018b; Koeser, 2018b), two of which (Koeser, 2018a; Koeser and Hicks, 2018c) were adapted from the &ldquo;Readux&rdquo; codebase (Koeser et al., 2017), which was previous developed at Emory University. In the process, we also used and made minor updates to a related, pre-existing module (Koeser, 2018c).</p>

    <p>For each of these tools, a use case emerged in one project which could be generalized for other projects, with potential for broader reuse. As an example, &ldquo;viapy&rdquo;&mdash;a Python module for searching and providing VIAF data to a web framework&mdash;was adapted from previous work, and first existed as code for one of the annotation projects, but it proved generalizable. &nbsp;In fact, it proved easier to extract as a reusable component rather than duplicate; one project team discovered a bug that had previously gone undetected, and creating a reusable package allowed us to correct the problem once for both projects. Likewise, code for storing and displaying annotations from the Readux project was ripe for repackaging as a general module because of its relatively direct purpose despite the different intellectual aims of these projects. However, these codebases also contain similar, potentially reusable functionality that is not yet ready for generalization.</p>

    <p>These projects provide a view into the ongoing process of balancing customized solutions to DH projects with generalizing focused portions of functionality. Modular design aimed at &lsquo;doing one thing and doing it well&rsquo; offers the possibility of creating an ecosystem of reusable packages that are widely useful and applicable, and can participate in a larger community of open source and other DH software research.</p>

  title: LIBER Workshop "Making Open Research Europe future-proof; plans for a sustainable
    and robust publishing platform"
  description: |-
    <p>With the approach of the one-year anniversary of Open Research Europe (ORE), the open access publishing platform launched by the European Commission, it is timely to review how the platform is going and look at how robust and future-proof it is. The platform provides all H2020 and Horizon Europe beneficiaries and their collaborators with an easy, high-quality platform to publish Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe funded research at no cost and in full compliance with the Commission&rsquo;s open access policies.<br>
    The vision of ORE is to deliver high quality, reliable and efficient publishing venue for EU research and a sustainable venue where grantees can publish post-grant the results of their work, while respecting their open access obligations. The European Commission&rsquo;s ambition is for ORE to lead by example in operationalising open science principles within scientific publishing while contributing to transparency and cost-effectiveness and exploring sustainable open access publishing business models.<br>
    <br>
    During this workshop, speakers will discuss how ORE has become a sustainable and robust publishing platform and how it will remain this way for the years to come. The discussion will be focused on the role(s) research libraries can play in supporting the long-term accessibility and preservation of ORE digital outputs, for example by integrating ORE into institutional repositories, and more broadly in supporting the take-up and sustainability of ORE within universities and other research institutions.<br>

  title: "OpenBio.eu - \nAn Open and Integrated Collaborative Bioinformatics Platform"
  description: |-
    <p>Despite the plethora of Workflow Management Systems (WMS), guidelines (i.e FAIR), source code repositories and Open Access Journals, reproducibility is still a major issue in bioinformatics and computational biology. This is mainly due to the unwillingness of authors to share ROs (Research Objects, i.e. Tools, Data, Workflows) and the introvert nature of modern WMSs. By introvert, we refer to the difficulty to interconnect ROs that belong to different WMSs (i.e. Galaxy, Nextflow and Snakemake), a task that requires above average IT skills. Moreover, ROs are still treated as components that are tightly coupled with their corresponding WMSs, whereas important social features like discussion, rating and crowdsourced editing are poorly supported.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>In this work, we present the enhanced version of OpenBio.eu, an environment that treats ROs as independent &ldquo;first class citizens&rdquo;. Namely, Data, Tools and Workflows are actual executable software components that contain the BASH commands that download, install, and run them without requiring any other dependency. The environment facilitates the indexing and combination of these ROs into new ROs without introducing any new DSL (Domain Specific Language). Exporting/importing to/from existing WMSs is a basic feature and a primary focus of development. Currently, we support Workflow export/import to Common Workflow Language (CWL) and we also support export in Airflow format. In OpenBio.eu, users are incentivised to import their ROs by taking credit when others are using them. Importing ROs is as easy as installing them in a PC. Users can directly download, execute, rate and comment on any RO. They can also &ldquo;Fork&rdquo; it and create a personal version that can edit as they wish. Similarly, users can compile Workflows by Drag and Dropping ROs in a graph. Workflows can be nested indefinitely, whereas conditional execution and iteration is naturally supported. We also present an execution engine that tights a resource manager (NetData) and a Workflow Execution Engine (Airflow) into a Docker container. Users can &ldquo;plug&rdquo; multiple execution engines and manage them through their personal profile page. OpenBio.eu also includes a knowledge graph environment that visualizes the discourse conducted on ROs and can help researchers choose the appropriate resources for their task.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Overall, OpenBio.eu is a free, extrovert and social environment aiming to maximize reproducibility and enhance the visibility of research in life sciences.</p>

  title: How "open" are universities? An Australian case study
  description: "<p><strong>The higher education sector is rapidly under pressure to
    evolve. One driving force is the commitment to &ldquo;openness&rdquo; in knowledge
    production and dissemination. While changes for open science and open access (OA)
    have picked up momentum in recent years, there remains much unknown in other areas
    of openness such as wider community engagements and inclusivity. &ldquo;Open knowledge
    institutions (OKIs)&rdquo; is a framework that advocates for universities to operate
    with principles of openness at their centre; not only should their research be
    made accessible, but they should lead positive changes to diversity, equity, transparency,
    etc.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>The Curtin Open Knowledge Initiative (COKI) is
    a project that sets out to explore different facets of OKIs. One of its aims is
    to build tools in supporting evidence-based strategies for universities to progress
    as OKIs. As such, COKI has collected and integrated data from a number of sources
    that relates to openness, including information on OA publications, research collaboration,
    social media activities, diversity, general online and physical accessibility;
    and, related aspirations and actions signaled through policies, infrastructure
    and annual reports.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>This presentation reports on the
    data and exploratory analysis for Australian universities focusing on the year
    2016 as a case study. This includes 43 Australian universities and 26 potential
    indicators for OKIs (plus an indicator on revenue). Initial descriptive analysis
    shows that many of these indicators are characterised by extreme observations,
    in addition to skewness, missing values and largely different measurement scales.
    These make it necessary to implement robust statistical methods, such as the use
    of Spearman&rsquo;s rank correlation, robust principal component analysis (PCA)
    and robust clustering methods.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Our analysis shows that
    the OKI indicators can be largely characterised into three groups of &ldquo;diversity&rdquo;,
    &ldquo;communication&rdquo; and &ldquo;coordination&rdquo;, which closely resembles
    the OKI evaluation framework proposed by Montgomery et al. (2018). We also show
    that the information provided by these indicators are high-dimensional and complex.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>The
    results also show evidence of:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>large
    disparities in indicators such as indigenous employment and gender equity.</strong></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>a
    strong negative correlation between diversity and physical accessibility.</strong></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>traditionally
    higher ranked universities (in international rankings) performing relatively worse
    in diversity indicators.</strong></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>a preference
    for repository-mediated OA.</strong></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>low correlation
    between university revenue and OA publishing; and, lower ranked universities do
    not necessarily perform worse in terms of proportion of OA outputs.</strong></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>synergies
    across universities within the same university network, which is most prominent
    for the Group of Eight.</strong></p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Although the
    study draws on data focused on Australian universities, many of the findings can
    be related to wider literature on universities. For example, there is clear correspondence
    to the general consensus that advances in gender diversity remain less in senior
    academic positions, and the probable links between OA performance and local policy
    strengths. The work also provides insights into challenges of data collection,
    integration, and analysis; and, a number of potential links between different
    aspects of university openness. These lay foundations for further large-scale
    and longitudinal studies.</strong></p>"

  title: 'The Open Science training handbook: Written by 14 international experts
    during the FOSTER Book Sprint'
  description: '<p>In February 2018, FOSTER Plus and TIB organized a book sprint in
    order to author an Open Science training handbook collaboratively. For one week,
    we brought together 14 experienced Open Science educators in Hanover to answer
    a number of questions: What works, what doesn&rsquo;t? How can you make the most
    of limited resources? With their help, we are creating a handbook that equips
    future trainers with methods, instructions, exemplary training outlines and inspiration
    for their own trainings. The handbook provides advocates across the globe with
    practical know-how to deliver Open Science principles to researchers, support
    staff, and research administrators. It is a living resource that is online accessible
    under the terms of CC0 1.0 license. The Open Science community was and will be
    able to review, comment and add other contributions such as discipline-specific
    case studies or translations after the book sprint. This is how we ensure the
    relevance of the handbook for a broad audience. In our ultimate goal to establish
    a robust, highly reusable resource on a certain topic in a short matter of time,
    we utilize two of the most prominent concepts and methods from the area of collaborative
    book writing: Book sprints and living books. Although the opportunities of both
    became apparent in the last few years, they still bear challenges, especially
    when applied to a loosely coupled, international audience of authors. We scrutinize
    our experiences all along the process, from the book preparation, through facilitating
    the book sprint itself, up to the reuse and enhancement of the book with different
    groups in different scenarios. Hereby, we hope to encourage and equip Open Education
    practitioners all over the world to make use of new open methods in the realm
    of collaborative book writing, like book sprints and maintaining open books, for
    their respective projects.</p>'

  title: 'New systems for Open Access books: an innovative platform from COPIM'
  description: |-
    <p>The Community-led Open Publication Infrastructures for Monographs is an international collaborative project bringing together a range of researchers, universities, librarians, open access book publishers and infrastructure providers (<a href="http://www.copim.ac.uk">www.copim.ac.uk</a>). We are seeking to build and maintain the infrastructures required to promote, sustain and distribute open access academic book publishing. Globally, books lag severely behind monographs in all OA initiatives. The COPIM online platform, tentatively titled Open Book Collective, directly addresses the recommendation to build the capacity of stakeholders to create, access, re-use, adapt and redistribute OER. The Open Book Collective (working title) will be a user-friendly, integrated platform to help stakeholders explore, discover, access and support OA books from a range of leading publishers and infrastructure providers via high-quality integrated metadata and a fully searchable catalogue. We aim to offer a choice of flexible subscription packages, through which patrons can choose to support individual publishers and schemes, or indeed the entire collective. Whilst our major stakeholders will be librarians and publishers, the catalogue and metadata functions will be freely available to everyone. We will also be providing space for OA publishers to display their current and forthcoming books. Our mission is to build and maintain an infrastructure to support the publication, discovery and distribution of OA books via a range of flexible subscription packages, and make it easy for OA books to be delivered to libraries. We have already partnered with the group of publishers that form the ScholarLed collective, with whom we are piloting the platform, but are building with the aim of flexible expansion to include more publishers in time. We have also partnered with JISC and DOAB, who are assisting in the management of revenue, curation, metadata and systems of preservation.</p>

    <p>Our previous work with librarians has informed us that whilst most institutional librarians are supportive of open education, they find the systems of OA publishing difficult and time-consuming to navigate. They find integrative metadata lacking, and struggle with the number of initiatives on offer. This in addition to limited library budgets, time, and restricted revenue cycles mean that many OA books which would be invaluable to open education are simply not finding their way into libraries. Our past workshop participants have told us that whilst traditional publishing giants have established systems and workflows for getting their books onto shelves and into catalogues, librarians are often unsure how to engage with open book publishers and where to find user-friendly information on their processes.</p>

    <p>In this session, I will introduce a range of stakeholders to the solutions COPIM and the Open Book Collective (working title) are developing in response to these problems, and invite attending librarians and publishers to join us in a program of consultative outreach. Our ultimate aim is to maximise the distribution of OA academic books and streamline the workflows that make them available in libraries, whilst building sustainable publishing models that keep education open for the future. In doing so, we are actively seeking input in developing the platform to best serve the needs of the open education community. We believe in &#39;scaling small&#39;: i.e., supporting small and medium publishers to operate through a diverse range of business models, and in networking, diversification and mutual support over centralization and hierarchization. Our key values are openness, transparency, accountability to stakeholders, and commonality. From this presentation, then, I hope to engage interested librarians and publishers in ongoing mutual assistance to create the infrastructures that will sustain open education in the future.</p>

  title: D4.7 Code for data exchange between TMT and open-source CAT software
  description: |-
    <p>This document is a report accompanying the SSHOC D4.7 Code for data exchange between TMT and open- source CAT software. The team has explored possibilities for data exchange between TMT and CAT tools, specifically MateCat and MyMemory, finding three areas where such a connection would be worthwhile to develop. As a first exploration, the team has focussed on TMT and MyMemory for single segment translation suggestions, resulting in the development of a demo tool.</p>

    <p>One of the goals of SSHOC is leveraging and interconnecting existing and new infrastructure from SSH ERICs. As part of this effort and more specifically task D4.7, the CentERdata team has explored possibilities for data exchange between TMT and CAT (Computer assisted translation) tools such as MateCat and MyMemory. For this purpose, the team has explored the general functionality of these tools and looked at possible areas where a connection between them would be feasible and worthwhile. For one of these areas a demo tool was implemented.</p>

    <p>TMT is a web-based tool developed by CentERdata to support the translation process of large multicultural and multilingual surveys, such as SHARE, ESS, EVS and others. It has a specific focus on questionnaire translation and allows the reuse of translations in longitudinal studies.</p>

    <p>MateCat is a freely accessible open-source CAT tool for the translation of collections of text such as documents. It offers options for machine translation, translation based on public Translation Memory and translation by translators.</p>

    <p>MyMemory is a large, publicly available source for translation memories, initially sourced from European Union and United Nations projects and populated by any translators using MateCat. It provides a search-like lookup of translated segments for a great number of language pairs in various subject domains and is used extensively by MateCat.</p>

    <p>The team has identified three areas where data exchange between these tools is worth exploring: 1) use of MyMemory for per-segment translation within the TMT interface; 2) use of MateCat for full questionnaire translations at the start of a project in TMT, based on an initial source version; and 3) export of TMT data for the purpose of contributing to MyMemory.</p>

    <p>For the current exploration, the team has focussed on the first area as this was already in line with other work connecting the LINDAT translation services to TMT. The implementation consists of an independent demo tool that allows users to enter text segments, which are communicated to the MyMemory service. The suggestions returned by MyMemory are then presented to the user. Each suggestion includes source language segments and translations, as well as a &ldquo;matching score&rdquo; (a measure of how closely suggestions made by MyMemory match the entered text segment). Suggestions with high matching scores are generally good but will require approval by the user to ensure translation quality.</p>

    <p>A conclusion reached is that a per-segment connection between TMT and MyMemory is feasible and adds value to the former, especially because a similar development with LINDAT translation has already been integrated into TMT. The project team has not done any implementation work for the remaining two areas, because these have far more complex translation quality and implementation considerations that are beyond the scope of this task. However, the CentERdata team is of the opinion that it is worth further exploring these possibilities in future research.</p>

  description: "<p><strong><a href=\"http://eurodoc.net/news/2021/eurodoc-input-on-unesco-open-science-recommendation\">Press
    release on&nbsp;Eurodoc input on UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science</a></strong><br>\n<em>written
    by Andrea Claudi&nbsp;</em><br>\n<br>\nIn October 2019, during its <a href=\"https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000370291\">40th
    General Conference</a>, <a href=\"https://en.unesco.org/\">UNESCO</a> set out
    its intention to draft a Recommendation on Open Science (OS) to be adopted by
    Member States in 2021. To build a global consensus on OS, UNESCO decided to adopt
    an <a href=\"https://en.unesco.org/science-sustainable-future/open-science/recommendation\">&ldquo;inclusive,
    transparent and consultative process&rdquo;</a>, including an online survey, which
    they launched in February 2020. A first draft of the UNESCO Recommendation on
    Open Science was published on 31 December 2020, and a second draft is expected
    to be published by the end of March 2021.</p>\n\n<p>Eurodoc participated in the
    whole process to express the European early-career researchers&rsquo; point of
    view on Open Science. Eurodoc considers Open Science to be a main pillar in career
    development and evaluation of ECRs and 19 January 2021, Eurodoc sent a comment
    on the first draft of the Recommendation on Open Science to UNESCO, identifying
    key aspects and obstacles on the path towards OS.</p>\n\n<p>Among the key aspects,
    Eurodoc highlighted the importance of training and support on OS practices and
    skills, and of the implementation of a proper reward system, including ECRs&rsquo;
    career assessment. Among the obstacles, Eurodoc directed UNESCO&rsquo;s attention
    to the imbalances between different countries, institutions and disciplines that
    could hinder the spread of OS.</p>\n\n<p>In&ecirc;s Almeida, Open Science and
    Employment and Careers WG co-coordinator comment:</p>\n\n<p>&laquo;Open Science
    (OS) is becoming the new standard in the research &amp; innovation arena, contributing
    to better research practices, fairer research assessment, better dissemination
    of knowledge and access to it, and the increased participation of society. However,
    there is currently no clear consensus on a OS definition, nor a strategic plan
    worldwide for this transition. For a successful implementation of OS, all relevant
    stakeholders should be involved, including researchers. However, the governments
    and institutions advocating for OS are not necessarily aware of the specific needs
    of these different stakeholders. We congratulate UNESCO for its initiative of
    creating a global recommendation using the contributions of all the relevant elements
    involved. We hope this global consensus can guide and facilitate a successful
    transition towards OS!&raquo;</p>\n\n<p>Giulia Malaguarnera, Eurodoc President,
    states:</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Eurodoc is fully committed to Open Science and we welcome
    UNESCO&rsquo;s efforts to build a worldwide consensus on it. We are happy to collaborate
    with UNESCO and with every other international organization seeking to raise awareness
    on Open Science and shape a different future for research, and we are determined
    to further the contribution of European early-career researchers on Open Science.&rdquo;<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Files</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Eurodoc

  title: A comprehensive study of the metadata standards used to implement a multidisciplinary,
    open data repository
  description: |-
    <p>Well-described metadata plays an important role in enabling the efficient storage, sorting, retrieval, sharing, and linking of scientific data. Different kinds of metadata standards have been developed to describe different kinds of data: text, images, video, etc. Several general standards have also been developed to meet the needs of the various scientific disciplines. Unfortunately, common elements of data description have a different status in each distinct metadata standard, and these differences hinder interoperability. This poster describes the effects of three important factors&mdash;universality, consistency, and interoperability of metadata&mdash;on the process of implementing a metadata schema for a multidisciplinary, open research data repository called the Bridge of Data.</p>

    <p>The Bridge of Data is a recently launched open research data repository developed as part of the &lsquo;Bridge of Data. Multidisciplinary Open Knowledge Transfer System - stage II: Open Research Data&rsquo;, a project co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund under the operational programme Digital Poland 2014-2020. The Bridge of Data Repository is one module of the Bridge of Knowledge platform (http://mostwiedzy.pl).</p>

    <p>Three important goals were taken into account when creating the metadata schema in order to reconcile existing standards.</p>

    <p>The first goal may be called &lsquo;general scheme for different fields of science&rsquo;. The repository is a collaborative project of three universities from the Pomeranian region representing many scientific disciplines. Because scientists have been unable to define metadata standards and requirements for the vast majority of research data, the crucial task was to render metadata usable for different fields of science. To this end, four hundred different sample sets of research data from various disciplines&mdash;including engineering and technology sciences,&nbsp; medical and health sciences, social science and humanities and others&mdash;were obtained and analyzed. These datasets were used to determine components of the metadata schema that will be mandatory for all data.</p>

    <p>The second goal may be called &lsquo;metadata granularity and compliance with metadata standards&rsquo;. The first step to achieve this goal was to compare commonly used metadata standards such as Dublin Core, Inspire, and DDI, which enabled metadata attributes that are common to these standards to be distinguished.</p>

    <p>The third goal may be called &lsquo;compliance with indexing services&rsquo; requirements&rsquo;. It was essential to prepare a metadata schema that would enable the Bridge of Data repository to be indexed in multidisciplinary and international databases. Verifying the mandatory requirements of such indexing repositories as Web of Science, DataCite, Re3data, OpenAIRE, and Google Dataset Search was one of the first steps in creating the schema. It was also necessary to associate metadata fields with other information from the Bridge of Knowledge platform, such as information about publications, projects, and the profiles of researchers.</p>

    <p>The result of this process was the creation of a metadata schema that consists of eight mandatory fields: description, author(s), year of publication, dataset language, field(s) of science, DOI, funding, and keywords. Two other fields, creation date and ethical papers, are optional.</p>

  title: 'Wikidata as an open, collaborative bibliographic database: the case of the
    National Library of Sweden'
  description: |-
    <p>Wikidata, one of Wikipedia&rsquo;s sister projects, is a free and open database of structured data. With its over 87 million linked data entities and a community of thousands of volunteers, it is occupying a unique position in the Open Knowledge landscape. By providing a structured yet flexible and content-agnostic framework for describing the world, as well as easy ways to query and access its contents, Wikidata gives data owners a collaborative platform to share and spread their resources.<br>
    <br>
    Wikidata is a great platform for sharing bibliographic data, and has attracted attention from libraries around the world, including the Library of Congress and the Association of Research Libraries. The National Library of Sweden has been working with Wikidata since 2018, in partnership with Wikimedia Sverige.<br>
    <br>
    The library made history by becoming the first national library to transition to Bibframe 2.0, a system based on Linked Open Data. This paradigm shift means that the data in the library&#39;s union catalog is easily available to the rest of the web. We are using this as a springboard to explore how a national library can use Wikidata to share its resources and better meet the needs of the open web and the Open Knowledge movement.<br>
    <br>
    An integral part of our collaboration is education and training about the Wikimedia platforms, giving Swedish librarians tools not only to understand them, but also to contribute with sources and other improvements themselves. Our common goal is that libraries should be able to meet the needs of the modern, open web by participating in the Open Knowledge movement and informing the public about how to look at and use Wikipedia as a source when they visit the libraries.<br>

  title: 8.2 Developing Infrastructure to Support Closer Collaboration of Aggregators
    with Open Repositories
  description: "<p>Over the past five years, the amount of open access content stored
    in repositories has increased dramatically. This has created new technical and
    organisational challenges for bringing this content together. The CORE (COnnecting
    REpositories) project has been dealing with these challenges by aggregating and
    enriching content from hundreds of open access repositories, increasing the discoverability
    and reusability of millions of open access outputs via its own search engine and
    API. The CORE project is now facing the challenge of how to enable content providers
    to manage content in the aggregation and control the harvesting process as repository
    managers and library directors often wish to know the details of the content harvested
    from their repositories and keep certain level of control over it.</p>\n\n<p>In
    order to improve the quality and transparency of the aggregation process and create
    a two-way collaboration between the CORE project and the providers of this content,
    we propose the CORE Dashboard. The aim of this dashboard is to provide an online
    interface for repository providers offering information about: the content harvested
    from the repository enabling its management, such as by requesting metadata updates
    or managing take-down requests, the times and frequency of content harvesting,
    including all detected technical issues and suggestions for improving the efficiency
    of harvesting and the quality of metadata, including compliance with existing
    metadata guidelines, statistics regarding the repository content, such as the
    distribution of content according to subject fields and types of research outputs,
    and the comparison of these with the national average.</p>\n\n<p>The benefits
    of using the CORE Dashboard are:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>&nbsp;Increased and simplified
    collaboration between the aggregator and the content provider.</li>\n\t<li>Better
    control of the content provider over the harvested content.</li>\n\t<li>Reduction
    of scepticism and fear of sharing content with other systems.</li>\n\t<li>Improvement
    of the harvesting process.</li>\n\t<li>Broadening of the open access content discoverability
    and thus reuse of the open access content where permitted.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The
    idea of the CORE Dashboard can be generalised to the collaboration of any aggregator
    with content providers (libraries, archives, etc.). The overall aim is to strike
    a balance between the ability of aggregators effectively disseminate content while
    allowing content providers to keep full control over it at all times.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Petr
    Knoth</strong>&nbsp;is a Research Fellow at the Knowledge Media Institute, The

  title: Challenges and opportunities of open science in transport research
  description: <p>The current technological advances and the rapid development of
    new collaborative tools have endorsed an on- going transformation of transport
    research enabling research information sharing. This systematic change of transport
    research covers a wide range of aspects, from evaluation of research, open access
    to research results, and relevant data infrastructures, all aiming at making science
    more efficient, better reproducible and more responsive to societal and economic
    expectations. In an attempt to address the above, this paper presents an action
    list of the different main aspects of Open Science in transport research of the
    European area exploiting previous initiatives and mapping among research areas
    with longer experience and&nbsp;more &ldquo;mature&rdquo; research fields. The
    novelty of the proposed action list is to contribute in implementing Open Science
    approaches in transport research enabling stakeholders to share and use all available
    knowledge at an earlier stage in the research process. The focus is given on the
    identification of guidelines that transport research stakeholders have to use
    to integrate open science in their current operations. This opening up of science
    and research is expected to lead to a European community of transport research
    stakeholders willing to work together and speed up the path from research to&nbsp;innovation
    and promote citizen&rsquo;s engagement in the scientific&nbsp;process.</p>

  title: Open OnDemand App Development and Integration
  description: |-
    <p>Open OnDemand (openondemand.org) is an NSF-funded open-source HPC platform currently in use at over 200 HPC centers around the world. It is an intuitive, innovative, and interactive interface to remote computing resources. Open OnDemand (OOD) helps computational researchers and students efficiently utilize remote computing resources by making them easy to access from any device. It helps computer center staff support a wide range of clients by simplifying the user interface and experience.<br>
    <br>
    This working session is meant to be an open discussion to guide the future roadmap for OOD in the near term, by getting feedback from the science gateways community on the development and integration of applications within OOD.<br>
    <br>
    Nearly any software application can be made accessible via OOD. The official OOD github repo currently has links to software that appeals to a wide range of scientific disciplines, such as Jupyter, Abaqus, ANSYS, COMSOL, MATLAB, RStudio, Tensorboard, QGIS, VMD, RELION, STATA and Visual Studio. The OOD development team is also aware of planned or ongoing work to integrate many other software packages and platforms, including many that are prominent within the Science Gateways community, such as Galaxy, TAPIS, Globus, and Pegasus.<br>
    <br>
    The OOD team has held more generic &lsquo;Birds of a Feather&rsquo; sessions at multiple PEARC and SC conferences in recent years as well as regular online webinars, each of which have seen significant attendance of many dozens of people. As the Gateways series of conferences has historically had many attendees from locations that utilize OOD, as well as attendees from many of the most prolific science gateways development teams, holding a working session to bring together some of these people is a natural fit for the conference.<br>
    <br>
    This proposed working group session is meant to follow that same general format as utilized at PEARC and SC in the past and be an open discussion to guide the future roadmap for OOD with regards to application development and integration. In following with our previous webinars and BoFs, key outcomes include a summary of the comments and discussion points, which include reports on installation and utilization issues from locations that currently have it installed, as well as a list of feature requests and development prioritizations. The initial slides that the organizers will present, briefly providing an OOD overview, roadmap summary and items of note will also be posted on our website for review by the community.</p>

  title: What role can Open Science play  in enabling South-North dialogues?
  description: |-
    <p>Transparency and open access in research are crucial to make the economy, medical services and thus society more effective and efficient. This applies to individual municipalities and regions within countries, nationwide, and ultimately also to the global society. The elephant in the room is evidently the ongoing climate change, as well as related global challenges and issues such as migration, environmental degradation, single nation economics, and conflict resolution. These topics are only partially separable; which is why transparent data collection and the utilisation of research results in our digital age are not only possible, but also urgently needed. Global threats and challenges resulting from climate change and political crises call for a new agenda to find solutions that work for not just a few but the global community.</p>

    <p>To provide more visibility and more opportunities to world-wide scientific discussions to African scientists we founded a region-specific preprint repository. Having a repository specific to the African research community can trigger interdisciplinary research within the continent as well as globally with research institutions overseas. The repository is a platform for African scientists to publish their research output immediately and free of cost. This makes it possible for them to receive feedback on their work, improve the manuscript for submission to a peer reviewed journal and identify potential collaboration partners for future projects.</p>

    <p>The repository can be used for project management in a local language for the manuscript to be submitted in a field specialized repository in English. We encourage submissions in languages that are commonly used by the scientific community in the respective country, such as English, French, Swahili, Zulu, Afrikaans, Igbo, Akan, or other native African languages.</p>

    <p>Researchers in Africa, Latin America and Southeast Asia now&nbsp;have the opportunity to find up to date research results through online publishing systems, databases and scientific service providers, make&nbsp;their own research output more visible and build transcontinental collaborations more effectively.</p>

    <p>Therefore, practiced Open Science allows for more diversity in research output and the convergence of the global scientific community.</p>

  title: '10.3 More Than Sum of its Parts: the Biodiversity Heritage Library as a
    Case Study in Open Science'
  description: |-
    <p>This case study demonstrates how the Biodiversity Heritage Library (BHL) partners have worked collaboratively to make biodiversity literature available as part of a global community. BHL (www.biodiversitylibrary.org) provides scientists, scholars and the public free and open access to nearly 46 million pages of digitised text and grey literature on biodiversity. BHL is mature and sustainable as a virtual organisation and digital repository. It supports open science and wider cultural uses by continuing to add relevant content, curating that content and enhancing access through the development and application of innovative tools. The availability and reusability of the scientific data accessible via BHL ranges from taxonomic study and training, biodiversity research, conservation and maintenance of diverse ecosystems, animal and plant disease control through to audiences beyond core science constituencies, including historical and cultural research on science, exploration and global commerce.</p>

    <p>Innovative services include data mining and taxonomic name finding so that the data that is of most value to scientists on that page are extracted from the OCR text (taxonomic names). An example of support for wider open use of content is the Art of Life Project supporting the extraction of illustrations within pages. Scientists are using BHL content during training courses and while on fieldwork. Virtual exhibitions of curated content are available, on broad interest topics such as exploration and spices.</p>

    <p>Working together has allowed partners to combine and link their collections in ways that provide a more complete research resource. Collaboration on standards, best practices and infrastructure solutions has produced better images, metadata and support tools, achievement of long-term digital storage solutions and the sharing and cost reduction of scanning operations.</p>

    <p><strong>Jane Smith</strong>&nbsp;joined the Natural History Museum in 2006 as Head of Library Collections and Services, and has been Head of the Department of Library and Archives since September 2012. The NHM Library and Archives (www.nhm.ac.uk/ library) holds one of the world&rsquo;s largest natural history collections of published works and original material, including manuscripts, maps and scientific artworks.

  title: Understanding the community's need for AI-ready open environmental data
  description: |-
    <p>This is the presentation material for NCAR Computational and Information Systems Lab Webinar on 20 April 2022. The work presented here includes the collaborative effort by Earth Science Information Partners Data Readiness Cluster.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Abstract for the webinar:&nbsp;Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly machine learning (ML), has shown great potential to accelerate scientific discovery and data-based application development in earth and environmental sciences. These AI/ML research and applications are driven by the enhancement of computing capabilities and rapidly growing open environmental data in public and commercial platforms. However, researchers and developers often spend a large amount of effort in accessing and preparing the data for specific use cases. To proliferate AI/ML development with open environmental data, we need to understand the community&rsquo;s need for data for efficient AI/ML development and develop community standards to improve future data services. Inspired by this need, the Earth Science Information Partners (ESIP) Data Readiness Cluster, including members from federal agencies, academic institutions, and private industry, developed a community roadmap for defining AI-readiness for environmental data and implemented a community survey to understand users&#39; needs for AI/ML development. In this presentation, I will present the road map developed by the Data Readiness Cluster and summarize the AI-ready data survey results as well as the draft AI-ready data checklist. The presentation will also discuss future community activities on implementing the lessons learned from the community survey to develop thematic AI-ready data collections through community collaborations.</p>

  title: Open Access Movement and Data
  description: Given the theme 'Data in a Networked World of Knowledge', what importance
    does the Open Access Movement have for data? Calls have been made for systems
    ensuring that publicly funded research results remain in the public domain, adhering
    to Open Access values of no economic or use-restrictive barriers between knowledge
    and those who wish access to the same. These include the National Institutes of
    Health and Wellcome Trust efforts for biomedical research, the declaration from
    the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development for open access to publicly
    funded research, and the United Nations World Summit on the Information Society
    discussing the same. And advocacy organizations such as the Alliance for Taxpayer
    Access have emerged, working to ensure that these values are realized. This paper
    examines and discusses some of these actors in the Open Access movement and how
    they may be seen to touch on 'data'.

  title: Perspectives on the Nature of Open Data in Business Cooperation
  description: |-
    <p>Finnish Universities of Applied Sciences (UAS) educate professionals solely based on labour market needs. The education follows tightly the needs of business, industry and service sectors. Research, development and innovation (RDI) work and regional development are two of the other mandated UAS tasks. RDI activities are typically heavily practice-oriented and have a strong regional impact. All RDI work is done in close cooperation with various partners generating new knowledge, competence, products and services for the region and beyond.</p>

    <p>The total volume of RDI activities in the Finnish UAS sector was around 180 M&euro; in 2018. There are more than 2 500 RDI projects running every year, most of them tightly linked with SMEs and other organizations. During the projects, a considerable amount of research data is produced. The data is created mostly based on interviews, surveys and measurements.</p>

    <p>In the Finnish UAS system, it is easy to see an ongoing transition into more open working methods in RDI projects. This relates to publications and data as well as research methods and processes in addition to results. Indeed, the well-known guideline &ldquo;as open as possible, as closed as necessary&rdquo; is gradually becoming a reality.</p>

    <p>Especially sharing data in a UAS context can speed up innovation and enhance the involvement of businesses and other working life organizations in the research process. In the UAS sector, there is a lot of RDI data, which could be utilised also in upcoming projects, possibly with totally different companies involved. However, are the UAS sector and businesses able to reuse the data in practice? Is the data findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR) also for businesses? What are the bottlenecks and practical challenges of curating RDI data and fostering data usage in general?</p>

    <p>In this poster, we present challenges of data management where the data is produced in co-creation with companies in the Finnish context. The co-creation of data generates obstacles related to ownership, ethical questions, confidential information and business secrets, among others. It can also be that businesses are not ready to open up the research data because of an ongoing patenting process.</p>

    <p>The more detailed purpose of the poster is to highlight what kinds of aspects should be considered in each phase of an open RDI process cycle to improve the dissemination and the use of research data in the future. In doing so, the poster attempts to identify the most critical issues relating to FAIR data management, especially in projects fundamentally linked with companies and other working life organizations.</p>

  title: 'Open Science in Switzerland: Opportunities and Challenges'
  description: <p>Open Science stands for a new approach to the scientific process,
    based on cooperative work and new ways of making knowledge available. It is thus
    an umbrella term for various movements aiming to remove the barriers to sharing
    any kind of output, resources, methods or tools, at any stage of the research
    process. Here, we focus on the open access to scientific literature and to data
    because of their particularly high relevance to the scientific community in Switzerland,
    at which this factsheet is primarily addressed. Both topics are also important
    science policy topics in different parts of the world, but the developments in
    Europe are most pertinent for Switzerland. This factsheet therefore presents the
    issues at stake in the on-going discussion in Europe and Switzerland, pointing
    out opportunities and addressing the challenges. The recommendations are guided
    by the key consideration to shape Open Access and Open Data so that they foster
    scientific progress and benefit society.</p>

  title: '11. Science Set Free: An Open Access Infrastructure for Europe'
  description: |-
    <p><strong>Recently launched, OpenAIRE2020 is the European Union initiative for an Open Access Infrastructure for Research which supports open scholarly communication and access to the research output of European-funded projects. The substantial technical infrastructure operates on two levels:</strong></p>

    <p>Gathering research outputs: OpenAIRE gathers open access content from a network of institutional and disciplinary repositories. To put this into practice, an integrated suite of guidelines has been developed so that data sources, namely literature and data repositories, OA publishers and CRIS systems can be harvested and their contents made more visible. The portal gives access to EU-funded scientific publications, and also provides monitoring tools for depositing and usage statistics.</p>

    <p>Policy harmonisation and community outreach: OpenAIRE has a collaborative and thriving &lsquo;human&rsquo; network, which is pan-European in nature. The community works to advance open access initiatives at national levels. It has National Open Access Desks in nearly 30 countries, and operates a European Helpdesk system for all matters concerning open access, copyright and repository interoperability.</p>

    <p>OpenAIRE is starting to move from a publication infrastructure to a more comprehensive infrastructure that covers all types of scientific output, and is establishing an infrastructure to harvest, enrich and store the metadata of scientific datasets. Cross-links from publications to data and funding schemes will be supported. This interlinking of research objects has implications for optimising the research process, allowing the sharing, enrichment and reuse of data.</p>

    <p>The poster presented will outline the activities of OpenAIRE. It will also highlight the following themes: advocating open access, repository guidelines, visibility of the European research environment, enhanced publications and sharing and reuse of research data.</p>

  title: What Does it Take to Make Networked and Open Science Sustainable?
  description: |-
    <p>The traditional scholarly cycle is being disrupted by interactions between new players, new services and new platforms, resulting in an emerging network of collaborators, communities and innovative forms of scholarly discourse that extend beyond the academy. Taking advantage of this network requires a transformation in the way we think about scholarly communication, and a transformation in the publishing industry to one that is focused on services rather than on products.</p>

    <p>The internet and Open Access are just the first steps. Both provide opportunities to drive down the fixed costs of traditional publishing and increase the accessibility and utility of published research but both create challenges. Production, distribution and dissemination can potentially become cheaper but the non-cash cost of peer review done by academics is largely unaffected and there are new costs in managing the transition to full open access and creating the networked infrastructure to support it.</p>

    <p>Publishing is at a cross roads. We can largely uphold 20th Century forms of publishing and scientific discourse and try and commodify and contain the network or we can fundamentally re-evaluate what is needed and what we want in this new environment. What are the services required to ensure that research is trustworthy and re-usable, disseminated effectively and efficiently, and evaluated appropriately? How can we foster systems and services that are transparent, open to new players, subject to real competition and which scale as the network grows?</p>

    <p>The sustainability of such a networked system of services will rest on a shared community governance across many different stakeholders, a governance that enables common standards, such as ORCID, and an interoperable infrastructure that can take advantage of rapidly changing technology. The bigger challenge is that it requires cooperation and trust among all stakeholders, including those that have traditionally been excluded from the scholarly lifecycle.</p>

  title: Open Innovation Laboratory for Rapid Realization of Sensing, Smart and Sustainable
    Products  (S3 Products) for Higher Education
  description: Higher education methods need to evolve because the new generations
    of students are learning in different ways. One way is by adopting emergent technologies,
    new learning methods and promoting the maker movement. As a result, Tecnologico
    de Monterrey is developing Open Innovation Laboratories as an immediate response
    to educational challenges of the world. This paper presents an Open Innovation
    Laboratory for Rapid Realization of Sensing, Smart and Sustainable Products (S<sup>3</sup>
    Products). The Open Innovation Laboratory is composed of a set of specific resources
    where students and teachers use them to provide solutions to current problems
    of priority sectors through the development of a new generation of products. This
    new generation of products considers the concepts Sensing, Smart, and Sustainable.
    The Open Innovation Laboratory has been implemented in different courses in the
    context of New Product Development (NPD) and Integrated Manufacturing Systems
    (IMS) at Tecnologico de Monterrey. The implementation consists of adapting this
    Open Innovation Laboratory within the course&rsquo;s syllabus in combination with
    the implementation of specific methodologies for product development, learning
    methods (Active Learning and Blended Learning using Massive Open Online Courses
    MOOCs) and rapid product realization platforms. Using the concepts proposed it
    is possible to demonstrate that students can propose innovative and sustainable
    products, and demonstrate how the learning process could be improved using technological
    resources applied in the higher educational sector. Finally, examples of innovative
    S<sup>3</sup> products developed at Tecnologico de Monterrey are presented.

  title: 'Exploring the food value chain using open innovation: a bibliometric review
    of the literature'
  description: |-
    <p>Purpose</p>

    <p>This paper reviews the literature, foundational works and current trends related to the adoption of open innovation (OI) practices in the food industry, with a particular focus on the food value chain, using a bibliometric and content analysis approach.</p>

    <p>Design/methodology/approach</p>

    <p>This study is based on 84 published documents in the field of food OI obtained using the Scopus database. First, a bibliometric analysis was conducted using a bibliographic coupling and co-citation analysis approach to understand the common themes and key clusters of food OI research. It further highlighted authors, countries, journals, years of publication and subject areas to comprehend the scope of the established literature. Second, a content analysis was undertaken to examine the titles and abstracts of the documents to explore the intersection of OI and the food value chain.</p>

    <p>Findings</p>

    <p>This study provides an integrated framework of the intersection of OI and the food value chain, including information about under-researched and emerging areas in the field of food innovation. It also highlights the critical challenges associated with OI food research and practices.</p>

    <p>Practical implications</p>

    <p>Practitioners can use the findings to uncover areas with limited open innovation adoption in the food value chain. They can identify extended research areas to explore the food value chain using an open innovation perspective, in different contexts within the food and beverage (F&amp;B) industry. The framework can also be used for conducting comparative studies of current food innovation trends across different contexts within the F&amp;B industry.</p>

  title: 'Linking OpenCourseWares and Open Education Resources: Creating an Effective
    Search and Recommendation System'
  description: |-
    With a growing number of digital libraries and other
    open education repositories being made available throughout the
    world, effective search and retrieval tools are necessary to access the
    desired materials that surpass the effectiveness of traditional, allinclusive
    search engines. This paper discusses the design and use of
    Folksemantic, a platform that integrates OpenCourseWare search,
    Open Educational Resource recommendations, and social network
    functionality into a single open source project. The paper describes
    how the system was originally envisioned, its goals for users, and
    data that provides insight into how it is actually being used. Data
    sources include website click-through data, query logs, web server
    log files and user account data. Based on a descriptive analysis of its
    current use, modifications to the platform's design are recommended
    to better address goals of the system, along with recommendations
    for additional phases of research.

  title: 'Open Data as Open Educational Resources: Case studies of emerging practice'
  description: |-
    <p>This collection presents the stories of our contributors&rsquo; experiences and insights, in order to demonstrate the enormous potential for openly-licensed and accessible datasets (Open Data) to be used as Open Educational Resources (OER). Open Data is an umbrella term describing openly-licensed, interoperable, and reusable datasets which have been created and made available to the public by national or local governments, academic researchers, or other organisations. These datasets can be accessed, used and shared without restrictions other than attribution of the intellectual property of their creators.While there are various de nitions of OER, these are generally understood as openly-licensed digital resources that can be used in teaching and learning.</p>

    <p>Open Data has been highlighted as a key to information transparency and scienti c advancement. Students who are exposed to the use of Open Data have access to the same raw materials that scientists and policy makers use. This enables them to engage with real problems at both local and global levels. Educators who make use of Open Data in teaching and learning encourage students to think as researchers, as journalists, as scientists, and as policy makers and activists. They also provide a meaningful context for gaining experience in research work ows and processes, as well as learning good practices in data management, analysis and reporting.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>The&nbsp;pedagogic deployment of Open Data as OER thus supports the development of critical, analytical, collaborative and citizenship skills, and has enormous potential to generate new knowledge.&nbsp;</p>

    on the side of the readers/receivers of scientific content. The design&nbsp;of

    a scoping review of literature, from which we draw design heuristics for knowledge
    construction in digital&nbsp;environments. Subsequently, we grouped the underlying
    technological functionalities into three design categories: i) structuring&nbsp;and
    supporting collaboration, ii) supporting the learning process, and iii) structuring,
    visualising and navigating (learning) content.&nbsp;Finally, we mapped the design
    categories and associated design heuristics to core components of popular open
    science platforms.&nbsp;This mapping constitutes a design space (design implications),
    which informs researchers and designers in the HCI community about&nbsp;suitable
    functionalities for supporting knowledge construction in existing or new digital

  title: 'CISE-1835674 – Collaborative Research: Elements: Software: NSCI: Chrono
    - An Open-Source Simulation Platform for Computational Dynamics Problems'
  description: <p>This project is augmenting modeling and solution methods employed
    by Chrono, an open-source computer simulation platform for multi-body dynamics
    (MBD) and fluid-solid interaction (FSI) problems. Chrono can capture dynamics
    at various size and time scales spanning from millisecond (impact phenomena) to
    decades (geophysics). These performance levels open up new directions of research
    in several fields. Chrono is widely used and further developed by other users
    and has an active forum with close to 500 registered users. This project is enhancing&nbsp;the
    richness of Chrono&#39;s modeling features, sound numerical solution foundation,
    and leverage of emerging hardware architectures to elevate this simulation capability
    to the status of ready-to-use, open-source, best-in-class computational dynamics
    platform. Chrono has been used by universities, national labs, and industry. Over
    the past two years, various groups have used Chrono in extraterrestrial applications,
    machine learning in robotics, image processing, pattern recognition and computer
    vision, mechanical watch design, architectural studies, autonomous vehicles, fluid-solid
    interaction applications, wind turbine dynamics, next generation space suit design,
    oil extraction and accident mitigation, hardware-in-the-loop simulation, etc.
    Finally, this project has engaged high-school students from under-represented
    groups in a six-day residential camp run (now at its 12th edition) and has trained
    a group of undergraduate students from California State University at University
    of Wisconsin-Madison through a new residential program that will introduce them
    to the use of Chrono in simulation-based robotics design.</p>

  title: 'Open Data as Open Educational Resources: Towards Transversal Skills and
    Global Citizenship'
  description: |-
    <p>Open Data is the name given to datasets which have been generated by international organisations, governments, NGOs and academic researchers, and made freely available online and openly-licensed. These datasets can be used by educators as Open Educational Resources (OER) to support different teaching and learning activities, allowing students to gain experience working with the same raw data researchers and policy-makers generate and use. In this way, educators can facilitate students to understand how information is generated, processed, analysed and interpreted.</p>

    <p>This paper offers an initial exploration of ways in which the use of Open Data can be key in the development of transversal skills (including digital and data literacies, alongside skills for critical thinking, research, teamwork, and global citizenship), enhancing students&rsquo; abilities to understand and select information sources, to work with, curate, analyse and interpret data, and to conduct and evaluate research. This paper also presents results of an exploratory survey that can guide further research into Open Data-led learning activities. Our goal is to support educators in empowering students to engage, critically and collaboratively, as 21st century global citizens.</p>

  title: IPERION-CH D.8.6 Two digital research resources available for open access
    on the web and one working resource
  description: |-
    <p>This deliverable is for task 4 in WP8, the Digital Documentation Research Work Package, is of the nature of a demonstrator. Therefore the main deliverables are the two digital research resources available for open access on the web (see URLs below) and one working resource for internal collaborative project use (see description below) rather than this document. The web resource should be accessed through a Google Chrome browser for the best experience. This document lays out the principles and some main points about the work carried out in constructing these research resources during the period since the last deliverable.</p>

    <p>Digital resource 1: The database of preparation layers in sixteenth-century Italian paintings is now available at https://research.ng-london.org.uk/iperion/. Digital resource 2: a beta version of an extended database of preparation layers in paintings that includes northern European seventeenth-century paintings and Italian seventeenth-century paintings in addition to those from Italian sixteenth-century paintings is available at https://research.ng-london.org.uk/iperion-tmp/. A working resource for internal collaborative project use is also presented, as is its application for a digital sampling point system at the National Gallery, and for documenting points of interest for a technical examination at the British Museum.</p>

    <p>It is intended to continue to use and to expand the content of these databases and resources in the future. The structures underlying the research resource are also re-usable, in that they can form a suitable template for research resources on completely different subjects. The intention is that after the end of IPERION-CH, some further work will be undertaken to make the code suitable for inclusion on GitHub and therefore accessible for use in the future.</p>

  title: Enhancing the Collective Knowledge for the Engineering of Ontologies in Open
    and Socially Constructed Learning Spaces
  description: 'The aim of this paper is to present a novel technological approach
    for enhancing the collective knowledge of communities of learners on the engineering
    of ontologies within a collaborative, open and socially constructed environment.
    The proposed technology aims at shaping information spaces into ontologies in
    a collaborative, communicative and learner-centered way during the ontology development
    life-cycle. The paper conjectures that such a collaborative environment can yield
    educational benefits, thus there is need to follow principles that apply in the
    Computer Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) paradigm. This work is mainly
    based on a collaborative and human-centered ontology engineering methodology and
    on a meta-ontology framework for developing ontologies, namely HCOME and HCOME-3O
    respectively. The integration of key technologies such as Semantic Wiki and Argumentation
    models with Ontology Engineering methodologies and tools serve as an enabler of
    learning spaces construction for different domain-specific information spaces
    in open settings. Inside these learning spaces innovative conceptualizations (both
    domain and development) are conceived, described by intertwined ontological meta-models
    following the HCOME-3O specifications for future reference and tutoring support.
    Such learning spaces support two types of ontology engineering courses: a) courses
    related to the know-how of shaping information spaces into ontologies (namely,
    the development knowledge) and b) courses related to the analysis of the domain
    itself (namely, the domain knowledge). The paper reports on the evaluation of
    the approach within a CSCL setting in Ontology Engineering, using the integrated
    set of tools and the framework that have been developed for the collaborative
    engineering of ontologies.'

  title: Does an open access journal about vegetation still make sense in 2020?
  description: <p>The current issue is the first one of the new version of Plant Sociology,
    the international peer-reviewed journal of the "Società Italiana di Scienza della
    Vegetazione" (SISV). The technical management of the journal has been entrusted
    to the editorial platform Pensoft, the Editorial Board has been largely reshaped,
    now including also a dedicated Social media team. Plant Sociology is focused on
    all aspects of vegetation from phytocoenosis to landscape level, through time
    and space, at different geographic and ecological scales; the journal contributes
    to spread around the issues related to management and conservation of plant communities
    and plant diversity. All the articles are freely available in Open Access (OA)
    with affordable article processing charge (APC). In the present Editorial, we
    briefly discuss the importance of opening the access to knowledge and data about
    vegetation. We believe that disseminating plant science might be a precious tool
    for understanding ecological processes, modelling future trends and supporting
    decision makers. The introduced technological improvement will hopefully allow
    a larger visibility and circulation for the papers published on Plant Sociology.</p>

  title: What role can Open Science play in enabling South-North dialogues?
  description: |-
    To provide more visibility and more opportunities to world-wide scientific discussions to African scientists we founded a region-specific preprint repository. Having a repository specific to the African research community can trigger interdisciplinary research within the continent as well as globally with research institutions overseas. The repository is a platform for African scientists to publish their research output immediately and free of cost. This makes it possible for them to receive feedback on their work, improve the manuscript for submission to a peer reviewed journal and identify potential collaboration partners for future projects.

    The repository can be used for project management in a local language for the manuscript to be submitted in a field specialized repository in English. We encourage submissions in languages that are commonly used by the scientific community in the respective country, such as English, French, Swahili, Zulu, Afrikaans, Igbo, Akan, or other native African languages.

    Researchers in Africa, Latin America and Southeast Asia now have the opportunity to find up to date research results through online publishing systems, databases and scientific service providers, make their own research output more visible and build transcontinental collaborations more effectively.

  title: '''Scaling Small'': A strategy to support scholar-led, open access book publishing'
  description: "<p>Open access (OA) book publishing is undergoing a period of transition.
    While scholar-led presses have long been at the forefront of OA book publishing,
    developing innovative business models and publication workflows and advocating
    for a broader shift to OA, larger commercial and university presses are now beginning
    to take OA books seriously. Community-led approaches such as the <a href=\"https://scholarled.org/\">ScholarLed
    consortium</a> and the <a href=\"http://radicaloa.disruptivemedia.org.uk/\">Radical
    Open Access Collective</a> may be threatened by <a href=\"https://group.springernature.com/gp/group/media/press-releases/new-open-access-book-partnership-with-uc-berkeley-library/18993926\">the
    emergent trend towards &#39;big deals&#39; and &#39;transformative&#39; agreements
    in the OA book world</a>, through which institutions and authors are encouraged
    to support only the &lsquo;big players&rsquo; with money or manuscripts, potentially
    leaving smaller and academic-led presses out in the cold.</p>\n\n<p>The &lsquo;scaling
    small&rsquo; approach (see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.16997/wpcc.918\">Adema
    &amp; Moore, 2021</a>) offers one alternative to this monopolistic vision, focusing
    on collaboration between smaller, academic-led and non-profit entities to build
    systems and infrastructures that provide mutual support at multiple scales. This
    &lsquo;scaling small&rsquo; philosophy is being put powerfully to work by the
    <a href=\"https://www.copim.ac.uk/\">Community-led Open Publication Infrastructures
    for Monographs (COPIM) project</a>, a major three-year international project bringing
    together libraries, scholar-led OA publishers, researchers, and infrastructure
    providers to build open, non-profit, community-governed infrastructures to expand
    the publication of OA books.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>COPIM, which includes members of
    both ScholarLed and the Radical Open Access Collective, is developing platforms
    and partnerships to address key technological, structural, and organisational
    hurdles around the funding, production, dissemination, discovery, reuse, and archiving
    of OA books. The project thus aims to build the structures that can sustain a
    diverse, scholar-led, not-for-profit OA publishing ecosystem according to the
    principle of &lsquo;scaling small&rsquo;. We are approaching the halfway point
    of our project and this paper will share insights into our progress so far, together
    with our plans for the next phase of our work, outlining how COPIM is putting

  title: Open-Source Integrated Simulation Framework for Cooperative Autonomous Vehicles
  description: <p>While many mature and reliable simulation engines exist for different
    system components, such as the network or the sensing and physics subsystems,
    the integration of these simulators into a single framework and workflow is not
    always a straightforward task. This paper presents such an integrated simulation
    framework, built from available open source components, focusing on cooperative
    autonomous vehicles research and development. The framework combines the CARLA
    simulation engine with the ETSI ITS-G5 implementation of the Artery/OMNET++ network
    simulator, as well as with selected functionality available in ROS, in order to
    provide a complete and high-fidelity integrated simulation environment which can
    be exploited for the development and testing of unaltered final code running in
    ROS-enabled devices.</p>

  title: Making Food Science Education and Research Activities More Attractive for
    University Students and Food Enterprises by Utilizing Open Innovative Space Approach
  description: |-
    <p>At the Savonia University of Applied Sciences (UAS),<br>
    curriculum and studies have been improved by applying an Open<br>
    Innovation Space approach (OIS). It is based on multidisciplinary<br>
    action learning. The key elements of OIS-ideology are work-life<br>
    orientation, and student-centric communal learning. In this approach,<br>
    every participant can learn from each other and innovations will be<br>
    created. In this social innovation educational approach, all practices<br>
    are carried out in close collaboration with enterprises in real-life<br>
    settings, not in classrooms. As an example, in this paper, Savonia<br>
    UAS&rsquo;s Future Food RDI hub (FF) shows how OIS practices are<br>
    implemented by providing food product development and consumer<br>
    research services for enterprises in close collaboration with<br>
    academicians, students and consumers. In particular one example of<br>
    OIS experimentation in the field is provided by a consumer research<br>
    carried out utilizing verbal analysis protocol combined with audiovisual<br>
    observation (VAP-WAVO). In this case, all co-learners were<br>
    acting together in supermarket settings to collect the relevant data for<br>
    a product development and the marketing department of a company.<br>
    The company benefitted from the results obtained, students were<br>
    more satisfied with their studies, educators and academicians were<br>
    able to obtain good evidence for further collaboration as well as<br>
    renewing curriculum contents based on the requirements of working<br>
    life. In addition, society will benefit over time as young university<br>
    adults find careers more easily through their OIS related food science<br>
    studies. Also this knowledge interaction model re-news education<br>
    practices and brings working-life closer to educational research<br>
    institutes.</p>

  title: Current Status of Indian Open Access Institutional Repositories (OAIRs) and
    Its Significance in Pandemic Era
  description: <p>The COVID-19 outbreak has affected the world among all segments
    of the population in all possible fields of life, viz health, economic, social
    &amp; educational. In India, the second wave of the pandemic brings the nightmare
    on repeat with a tsunami of cases. To encounter this critical situation and to&nbsp;safeguard
    the health of the students &amp; faculty members, the education system undergoes
    a significant change, from conventional classroom-based learning to online interaction-based&nbsp;teaching-learning.
    This turnabout demands the availability of sufficient e-content. In this situation,&nbsp;OAIRs
    as a free-to-use platform with a voluminous amount of data, are able to help users
    including&nbsp;the institutions in coping with financial critical situations as
    well as enabling the learning process. This study aims to determine the current
    status of Indian OAIR housed in OpenDOAR by conducting&nbsp;a user survey to assess
    its importance in assisting academics and the education system during this current
    pandemic situation. The findings of the study reveal that DSpace (58%) is the
    dominant software in Indian OAIRs while English (96.43%) is the most prominent
    language. Additionally, the study also identifies the continual growth of Indian
    OAIRs with regular updation. According to the&nbsp;survey result, library staff
    and researchers are the most experienced regarding the importance and benefits
    of OAIRs, whereas students need to be more aware. Overall, the survey agrees with
    the&nbsp;fact that, in India, OAIRs support the significant change in the education
    system as well as promote&nbsp;web accessibility and eliminate the digital divide.</p>

  title: Evaluation of current European open science initiatives in transport research
  description: <p>Latest technological developments have endorsed the creation of
    new collaborative tools and enabling transport research community information
    sharing. Following these technological directives, European Commission is continuously
    developing appropriate initiatives that aim at making science more efficient and
    reproducible to societal and economical expectations. This paper conducts an analysis
    and evaluation of exploited Open Science initiatives and open access platforms
    in Europe. The proposed analysis presents clusters of possible use areas with
    respect to different challenges that key actors in transport research may face.
    The focus is given on the evaluation of different combined factors which could
    be used as a qualitative measurement for existing Open Science tools. Subsequently,
    relevant stakeholders could acknowledge the existence of Open Science initiatives
    and the way to use them efficiently in order to enhance a collaborative, innovative
    and transparent research environment.</p>

  title: 'Ants-Review: a Bounty-like system for Open Anonymous Scientific Peer-Reviews'
  description: <p>Peer-review is a necessary and essential quality control step for
    scientific publications. However, the process, which is very costly in terms of
    time investment, not only is not remunerated but it&rsquo;s also not recognized
    by the academic community as a relevant scientific output for a researcher. Therefore,
    scientific dissemination is affected. Here, to solve this issue we propose a blockchain-based
    incentive protocol that rewards scientists also for their contributions to other
    scientists&rsquo; work and that builds up a reputational system. We designed a
    basic Bounty-like contract called <em><strong>AntsReview </strong></em>that allows
    any author to issue a call for peer-reviewing their scientific publication. If
    requirements are met, peer-reviews will be audited by an external editor and payed
    by the Issuer. To promote ethical behaviour the system will implement a quadratic
    funding on AntsReview.</p>

  title: The Changing Landscape and Future of Open Access in India
  description: <p>The past few years have seen a tremendous change in information
    production and growth with new knowledge disciplines added into academics. With
    journal subscription costs increasing at 8-10% annually (Miller 2015), libraries
    worldwide are finding it difficult to sustain subscription costs to scholarly
    material. On the other hand, making information and data available in interoperable
    electronic formats freely is a concept that is gaining momentum and OA (Open Access)
    holds promise to remove both price and permission barriers to scientific communication
    with the help of the internet. Scientists, policymakers, NGOs, government agencies
    and librarians are also collaborating together for OA implementation and making
    knowledge affordable to all. OA journals play a key role in making scholarly material
    immediately available on the internet. Introduction The OA movement in India started
    by advocates like Subbiah Arunachalam is more than a decade old. It is now gaining
    momentum with various organizations and departments under the Government of India
    such as the DBT (Department of Biotechnology) and DST (Department of Science and
    Technology) adopting OA policies in 2014. However, there is a long way to go as
    India does not have a national OA mandate for public-funded research. Few universities
    and institutions in this region have adopted an OA mandate on university-funded
    research. It seems that while the awareness about making research outputs publicly
    available has certainly increased within academia, the steep increase in the number
    of questionable journal publishers around the world has created a misunderstanding
    about the credibility and value of adopting the OA publishing route. This paper
    attempts to provide an account of the changing landscape of OA in India and proposes
    recommendations that can be taken to improve the adoption of OA in India.</p>

  title: 'Open Forest Data: Digitalizing and building an online repository'
  description: '<p>Poland is characterised by a relatively high variety of living
    organisms attributed to terrestrial and water environments. Currently, close to
    57.000 species of living organisms are described that occur in Poland (Symonides
    2008), including lowland and mountain species, those attributed to oceanic and
    continental areas, as well as species from forested and open habitats. Poland
    comprehensively represents biodiversity of living organisms on a continental scale
    and thus, is considered to have an important role for biodiversity maintenance.</p><p>The
    Mammal Research Institute of Polish Academy of Sciences (MRI PAS), located in
    Białowieża Forest, a UNESCO Heritage Site, has been collecting biodiversity data
    for 90 years. However, a great amount of data gathered over the years, especially
    old data, is gradually being forgotten and hard to access. Old catalogues and
    databases have never been digitalized or publicly shared, and not many Polish
    scientists are aware of the existence of such resources, not to mention the rest
    of the scientific world.</p><p>Recognizing the need for an online, interoperable
    platform, following FAIR data principles (findable, accessible, interoperable,
    reusable), where biodiversity and scientific data can be shared, MRI PAS took
    a lead in creation of an Open Forest Data (OFD) repository. OpenForestData.pl (Fig.
    1) is a newly created (2020) digital repository, designed to provide access to
    natural sciences data and provide scientists with an infrastructure for storing,
    sharing and archiving their research outcomes. Creating such a platform is a part
    of an ongoing development of life sciences in Poland, aiming for an open, modern
    science, where data are published as free-access. OFD also allows for the consolidation
    of natural science data, enabling the use and processing of shared data, including
    API (Application Programming Interface) tools. OFD is indexed by the Directory
    of Open Repositories (OpenDOAR) and Registry of Research Data Repositories (re3data).</p><p>The
    OFD platform is based entirely on reliable, globally recognized open source software:
    DATAVERSE, an interactive database app which supports sharing, storing, exploration,
    citation and analysis of scientific data; GEONODE, a content management geospatial
    system used for storing, publicly sharing and visualising vector and raster layers,
    GRAFANA, a system meant for storing and analysis of metrics and large scale measurement
    data, as well as visualisation of historical graphs at any time range and analysis
    for trends; and external tools for database storage (Orthanc) and data visualisation
    (Orthanc plugin Osimis Web Viewer and Online 3D Viewer (https://3dviewer.net/),
    which were integrated with the system mechanism of Dataverse. Furthermore, according
    to the need for specimen description, Darwin Core (Wieczorek et al. 2012) metadata
    schema was decided to be the most suitable for specimen and collections description
    and mapped into a Dataverse additional metadata block. The use of Darwin Core
    is based on the same file format, the Darwin Core Archive (DwC-A) which allows
    for sharing data using common terminology and provides the possibility for easy
    evaluation and comparison of biodiversity datasets. It allows the contributors
    to OFD to optionally choose Darwin Core for object descriptions making it possible
    to share biodiversity datasets in a standardized way for users to download, analyse
    and compare.</p><p>Currently, OFD stores more than 10.000 datasets and objects
    from the collections of Mammal Research Institute of Polish Academy of Sciences
    and Forest Science Institute of Białystok University of Technology. The objects
    from natural collections were digitalized, described, catalogued and made public
    in free-access. OFD manages seven types of collection materials:</p>3D and 2D
    scans of specimen in Herbarium, Fungarium, Insect and Mammal Collections,images
    from microscopes (including stereoscopic and scanning electron microscopes),morphometric
    measurements,computed tomography and microtomography scans in Mammal Collection,mammal
    telemetry data,satellite imagery, geospatial climatic and environmental data,georeferenced
    historical maps.<p>In the OFD repository, researchers have the possibility to
    share data in standardized way, which nowadays is often a requirement during the
    publishing process of a scientific article. Beside scientists, OFD is designed
    to be open and free for students and specialists in nature protection, but also
    for officials, foresters and nature enthusiasts. Creation of the OFD repository
    supports the development of citizen science in Poland, increases visibility and
    access to published data, improves scientific collaboration, exchange and reuse
    of data within and across borders.</p>'

  title: Open Science for Arts Design and Music (project proposal and evaluation)
  description: '<p>The disciplinary fields of Arts (photography, visual and performing
    arts, such as dance, theatre and cinema), Design (including sub-disciplines such
    as visual communication, industrial design, fashion design and interaction design)
    and Music (including sound and aural arts) present a series of complex issues
    related to the reuse and distribution of artwork and of third parties content
    under copyright, not accessible in public domain and subject to a series of restrictions.
    These disciplinary fields produce a wide range of multimedia outputs, they imply
    action-research and practice-based research, and they collaborate with specialized
    national Swiss publishing houses. This situation makes the implementation of Open
    Access in the disciplinary fields of ADM (Arts, Design and Music) particularly
    complex. At the same time, practices developed within these fields address issues
    which are relevant in other disciplines. The present project proposal aims at
    supporting the Swiss disciplinary field of ADM in implementing the swissuniversities
    Open Access action plan 2021-2024 in collaboration with key stakeholders. More
    specifically the project involves a network of Swiss schools of ADM and it develops
    centralised and local services. The centralised service produces guidelines and
    solutions for a selection of case studies with the support of a legal team, it
    produces webinars and training for the local staff, it involves Swiss institutions
    in international networks and it triggers Green and Gold Open Access among the
    publications in the field of ADM. At a local level, the different schools involved
    notify case studies, receive training and coaching to support their researchers,

  title: 'The Open Education policy registry: An open benchlearning tool'
  description: "<p>Open Education does not occur in a vacuum; ergo, policies aimed
    at fostering sustainable growth of Open Educational Practices (OEP) must acknowledge
    that such practices sit within a wider landscape of socioeconomic and educational
    ecosystems aiming to widespread efforts to democratise access to research and
    knowledge; however, the development of national and institutional-level OER &amp;
    OEP policies appears to lag behind, therefore, the main objective of the OE policy
    registry is to become a hub for benchlearning, supporting institutions and communities
    of practice to develop OE policies that promote ethical developments of OE (Atenas
    et al, 2019).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Much discussion of the need for open education policy
    has occurred at the supranational level. International OE declarations (e.g. <a
    href=\"https://oerworldmap.org/resource/urn:uuid:4860f714-2c67-414b-bc51-18eb84691e48\">Cape
    Town Declaration, 2007</a>; <a href=\"https://oerworldmap.org/resource/urn:uuid:37fbdbc5-982a-45a9-b0e8-fc4f26d7107a\">Paris

    2019</a>) have called for an OE ethos to be embedded within wider education policy,
    as it is understood as a key spur to democratise access to quality education.
    Nowadays, a series of international initiatives are attempting to stimulate action
    on educational and scientific openness, including guidelines to foster sustainable
    policies. In some cases, nations and subnational governments have taken up the
    challenge of incorporating policy to enable open resources and practices into
    education policymaking agendas. What is less clear, and less straightforward to
    investigate, is the extent to which individual institutions are developing policies
    to support openness.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Our session at OER20, reported on the current
    state of OE policies internationally, based on the OE Policy Registry dataset.
    Through engagement with the data held in the Policy Registry it has been possible
    to collect and examine a wide range of policy documents and sketch some key features
    of the OE policy landscape. Further auditing of this dataset is needed, in order
    that the registry can be used effectively to support policy benchlearning by OE
    advocates, researchers and policymakers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>This session presented
    the initial findings of a research project conducted using this dataset, and additionally,
    inputs gained during a series of workshops designed to support OE policy co-creation.
    We presented key features of the OE Policy Registry to support&nbsp;</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>OE
    advocates seeking to support and enhance practice through policy&nbsp;</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Policymakers
    at institutional and governmental levels</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Researchers
    interested in OE policy</p>\n\t</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>For these user groups, several
    different use-cases are addressed and presented:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Policymakers
    can showcase and find good practice policy exemplars, which they can adapt and
    reuse within their context.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>OER advocates and advocacy
    networks can connect with each other, so that they can exchange experiences and
    cooperate in joint projects.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Researchers can collect
    data on policy activities in different educational sectors and geographical areas,
    gaining a deeper understanding of the functioning of OE ecosystems and develop
    strategies for mainstreaming.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>"

  title: 'CFARS Site Suitability Initiative: An Open Source Approach to Evaluate the
    Performance of Remote Sensing Device (RSD) Turbulence Intensity Measurements &
    Accelerate Industry Adoption of RSDs for Turbine Suitability Assessment'
  description: |-
    <p>In this white paper, the results from the Consortium for Advancing Remote Sensing&#39;s (CFARS) Site Suitability Subgroup&rsquo;s first benchmarking analysis of <em>unadjusted</em> RSD to cup anemometer turbulence intensity (TI) and reference cup-to-redundant cup measurement differences are presented. Eight organizations participated in the benchmarking activity, contributing a total of 35 datasets.</p>

    <p>This document introduces the Subgroup&rsquo;s forthcoming analysis, examining the performance of <em>adjusted</em> RSD TI measurements compared to cup anemometry.&nbsp; This will be the industry&rsquo;s first open source tool for comparing the performance of disparate RSD TI measurements and cup anemometry, the TI Adjustment Comparison Tool (TACT). TACT incorporates more than 15 adjustment techniques.&nbsp;Preliminary results from this benchmarking activity using TACT will be released to the industry in the Spring 2022 and summarized in detail in a forthcoming peer-reviewed article.</p>

    <p>Finally, to ensure the delivery of commercial value to open source science and tools generated in the Subgroup, a best practice collaboration framework to connect RSD TI benchmarking activities with RSD TI acceptance decision-making for site suitability assessment is introduced herein.&nbsp;The CFARS best practice framework provides a platform that enables data-driven decisions, on acceptable loads bias thresholds in a commercial setting. The framework encourages industry stakeholders to collaborate to further refine TACT, leverage the tool to advance industry understanding of the sensitivity of turbine fatigue load models to varying TI measurements and therefore de-risks the use of adjusted RSD measurements in site suitability assessment.</p>

  title: Educating data literacy – a holistic concept. A best practice example for
    open science education.
  description: |-
    <p>The poster presents a holistic concept for open science education and in particular data literacy as well as research data management [RDM] developed by the project <em>bw2FDM</em> in BadenW&uuml;rttemberg. Faced with a multitude of courses, webinars and other training opportunities dedicated to these topics, just adding more is not an efficient approach. Rather cooperation and coordination are essential. Therefore, original content is combined with networking efforts on a state as well as federal level in order to achieve synergies.</p>

    <p>Nevertheless, the creation of a multifaceted set of training opportunities is a core part of our project. This meshes different didactic formats. A main component is an asynchronous online course &ldquo;<em>Open Science: Von Daten zu Publikationen</em>&rdquo; [1] that covers different aspects of RDM from a practical, technical and legal view. This course has even become part of the regular curriculum at the University of Constance. It is complemented by training sessions and webinars that delve deeper into specific issues. Furthermore, <em>bw2FDM</em> is responsible for the information platform<em> forschungsdaten.info</em>, which offers a comprehensive collection of articles covering a wide variety of RDM matters. None of these services is limited to a specific institution, rather they are aimed at the entire German-speaking community.</p>

    <p>However, <em>bw2FDM</em> strives to avoid insular solutions as well as duplicating the efforts of other RDMexperts. In consequence, we initiated a working group dedicated to RDM-training in BadenW&uuml;rttemberg. This is not just a forum for exchange but also a nucleus for cooperative solutions to data literacy education. The same approach has been applied to foschungsdaten.info: partnerships with 18 other institutions made it possible to assemble a diverse and highly specialized editorial staff that consistently provides new content and improves the platform. Recently, a new series of webinars under the label <em>forschungsdaten.info live</em> has been launched that has these experts join efforts in order to tailor training session for specific scientific communities. For example, the first webinar focused on geosciences.</p>

    <p>Last but not least, a special focus lies on sustainability. For that reason, all educational resources as well as the content of <em>forschungsdaten.info</em> are published under open licenses such as CC BY 4.0 or under a copyright waiver like CC0 1.0. This ensures their reusability and enables other institutions to adept the materials for their own purposes without legal limitations. Moreover, we are optimistic that our cooperative approach to RDM education will increase the long-term effectiveness of our efforts and might even serve as a blueprint for other institutions.</p>

  title: Whose Infrastructure? Towards Inclusive and Collaborative Knowledge Infrastructures
    in Open Science
  description: <p>The current discourse around Open Science has tended to focus on
    the creation of new technological platforms and tools to facilitate sharing and
    reuse of a wide range of research outputs. There is an assumption that once these
    new tools are in place, researchers&mdash;and at times, members of the general
    public&mdash;will be able to participate in the creation of scientific knowledge
    in more accessible and efficient ways. While many of these new tools have indeed
    assisted in the ease of collaboration through online spaces and mechanisms, the
    narrowness of how infrastructure is imagined by open science practitioners tends
    to put the use of technology ahead of the issues that people are actually trying
    to solve, while failing to acknowledge the systemic constraints that exist within
    and between some communities. Drawing on an analytical framework grounded in Black
    feminist intersectionality (Noble, &ldquo;A Future&rdquo;), this paper highlights
    the need for more inclusive knowledge infrastructures, particularly in the context
    of fair and sustainable development. Three case studies from the Open and Collaborative
    Science in Development Network (OCSDNet), are outlined in order to illustrate
    the importance of moving beyond a definition of infrastructure as merely a technical
    or physical entity. These cases, arising from research conducted in South Africa,
    Brazil and the Caribbean, demonstrate how more sustainable and nuanced forms of
    collaboration and participation may be enabled through broader understandings
    of knowledge infrastructures. This paper further argues that leveraging the feminist
    concept of intersectionality when conceptualizing the development of knowledge
    infrastructures could be one way to move from narrow assumptions about standardized
    knowledge &ldquo;users&rdquo; towards more inclusive reimaginings of how a plurality
    of knowledge can be produced and shared via networked technologies.</p>

  title: Landscapes, maps and territories of open education policy  … where do we
    go from here?
  description: |-
    <p>As we know, a map is not the same thing as the territory it claims to represent. A landscape whether viewed, photographed or painted again attempts representation, but is a snapshot of a moment, taken from a certain angle. The territory always contains so much more, so much that is unknown.</p>

    <p>We have recently been working on the topic of OE policy from the angles of landscape and maps; collecting, curating and reviewing in order to build up a big picture of the current state of policy, and trying to devise pathways towards desired policy destinations. In both cases the territory that concerns us, that we are trying to understand and navigate, is the real world of the lived experience of learning, teaching, creation and collaboration inside and outside of educational organisations, by educators, and of those who seek learning through formal or other channels. This territory is also a research field, within which the limits or remit of OE remain an open question. OE researchers increasingly consider interrelationships between open content, practices, and educators, and between the practices engaged in and the reasons for doing so.</p>

    <p>In this session we propose to discuss findings from our review of the makeup of the current landscape of OE policy, to highlight the current direction of travel. Furthermore, we will argue that in seeking pathways towards open futures, we may need to recalibrate our instruments to better reflect the rich and complex territory of actual practices.</p>

  title: Open-Cavity in Closed-Cycle Cryostat as a Quantum Optics Platform
  description: |-
    <p>The introduction of an optical resonator can enable efficient and precise interaction between a photon<br>
    and a solid-state emitter. It facilitates the study of strong light-matter interaction, polaritonic physics and<br>
    presents a powerful interface for quantum communication and computing. A pivotal aspect in the progress<br>
    of light-matter interaction with solid-state systems is the challenge of combining the requirements of cryo-<br>
    genic temperature and high mechanical stability against vibrations while maintaining sufficient degrees of<br>
    freedom for in situ tunability. Here, we present a fiber-based open Fabry-P&eacute;rot cavity in a closed-cycle<br>
    cryostat exhibiting ultrahigh mechanical stability while providing wide-range tunability in all three spatial<br>
    directions. We characterize the setup and demonstrate the operation with the root-mean-square cavity-<br>
    length fluctuation of less than 90 pm at temperature of 6.5 K and integration bandwidth of 100 kHz.<br>
    Finally, we benchmark the cavity performance by demonstrating the strong-coupling formation of exciton<br>
    polaritons in monolayer WSe2 with a cooperativity of 1.6. This set of results manifests the open cavity in<br>
    a closed-cycle cryostat as a versatile and powerful platform for low-temperature cavity QED experiments.</p>

  title: A Review on Blockchain Technology and Blockchain Projects Fostering Open
    Science
  description: |-
    <p>Many sectors, like finance, medicine, manufacturing, and education, use blockchain<br>
    applications to profit from the unique bundle of characteristics of this technology.<br>
    Blockchain technology (BT) promises benefits in trustability, collaboration, organization,<br>
    identification, credibility, and transparency. In this paper, we conduct an analysis in which<br>
    we show how open science can benefit from this technology and its properties. For this,<br>
    we determined the requirements of an open science ecosystemand compared themwith<br>
    the characteristics of BT to prove that the technology suits as an infrastructure. We also<br>
    review literature and promising blockchain-based projects for open science to describe<br>
    the current research situation. To this end, we examine the projects in particular for their<br>
    relevance and contribution to open science and categorize them afterwards according<br>
    to their primary purpose. Several of them already provide functionalities that can have a<br>
    positive impact on current research workflows. So, BT offers promising possibilities for<br>
    its use in science, but why is it then not used on a large-scale in that area? To answer<br>
    this question, we point out various shortcomings, challenges, unanswered questions,<br>
    and research potentials that we found in the literature and identified during our analysis.<br>
    These topics shall serve as starting points for future research to foster the BT for open<br>
    science and beyond, especially in the long-term.</p>

  title: 'DINA: Open Source and Open Services - A modern approach for natural history
    collection management systems and research'
  description: |-
    <p>The DINA Consortium ("DIgital information system for NAtural history data", https://dina-project.net) was formed in order to provide a framework for like-minded large natural history collection-holding institutions to collaborate through a distributed Open Source development model to produce a flexible and sustainable collection management system. Target collections include zoological, botanical, mycological, geological and paleontological collections, living collections, biodiversity inventories, observation records, and molecular data. DINA is funded by the participating member institutions. DINA Core Members are organizations or individuals who commit at least one half-time equivalent of resources to the development of the consortium goals, at least half of which should be available for code development.</p>
      <p>The DINA system is architected as a loosely-coupled set of several web-based modules. The conceptual basis for this modular ecosystem is a compilation of comprehensive guidelines for Web application programming interfaces (APIs) to guarantee the interoperability of its components. Thus, all DINA components can be modified or even replaced by other components without crashing the rest of the system as long as they are DINA compliant. Furthermore, the modularity enables the institutions to host only the components they need. DINA focuses on an Open Source software philosophy and on community-driven open development, so the contributors share their development resources and expertise outside of their own institutions.</p>
      <p>One of the overarching reasons to develop a new collection management system is the need to better model complex relationships between collection objects (typically specimens), research data and associated workflows. We will present the enhancements provided by the approach of the DINA system focussing on the flexibility to plug in compliant components and accommodate additional (meta-)data and specimen related research data with the help of a generic data module.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, we will discuss challenges in the governance of the development activities such as organizing the distributed code development of the core modules, the code review process and the choice of the software stack. These organizational challenges will be overcome with the help of a revised Memorandum of Understanding.</p>

  title: 'The COPIM project platform: New infrastructures for Open Access books'
  description: |-
    <p>The Community-led Open Publication Infrastructures for Monographs is a collaborative project bringing together an international range of researchers, universities, librarians, open access book publishers and infrastructure providers (<a href="https://www.copim.ac.uk">www.copim.ac.uk</a>). I present here the project of Work Package 2: to build and maintain a collective and platform required to promote, sustain and distribute open access academic book publishing. The Open Book Collective (working title) will be a user-friendly, integrated platform to help stakeholders explore, discover, access and support OA books from a range of leading publishers and infrastructure providers via high-quality integrated metadata and a fully searchable catalogue. We aim to offer a choice of flexible subscription packages, through which patrons can choose to support individual publishers and schemes, or indeed the entire collective. Whilst our major stakeholders will be librarians and publishers, the catalogue and metadata functions will be freely available to everyone. We will also be providing space for OA publishers to display their current and forthcoming books and access library revenue streams that may have previously been unavailable to them. We have partnered with the group of publishers that form the <a href="https://scholarled.org/">ScholarLed</a> collective, with whom we are piloting the platform, but are building with the aim of flexible expansion to include more publishers in time. We have also partnered with JISC and DOAB, who are assisting in the management of revenue, curation, metadata and systems of preservation. This presentation introduces the work we have done so far and invites attendees to join us in our process of consultative outreach as we further develop the platform.</p>

    collaboration and knowledge sharing across the SSH communities'
  description: |-
    <p>SSH Open Marketplace Curation Strategy: Relies on harvesting from third parties while emphasising community-curation by its users, our valued SSH researchers and scholars.<br>
    Free and Open: The SSH Open Marketplace advocates open science and open access and so the information in the marketplace is freely accessible. It is not a place for buying and selling something.</p>

    <p>A social infrastructure: The emphasis on community-based curation makes the SSH Open Marketplace a social infrastructure. Its usage relies on the SSH community to refine, update and correct information on the marketplace as an information brokering service with CLARIN and DARIAH experiences playing a key role.</p>

    <p>Role of LIBER: A community of practitioners and specialists with expertise on two key aspects of the SSH Open Marketplace: community involvement for curation and experience in collecting/structuring/exposing information.</p>

    <p>Value Proposition:</p>

    <p>The unique value of the SSH Open Marketplace as a discovery portal of Tools and Services is its connection to relevant Training Materials, Publications, Datasets, and Workflows. The SSH Open Marketplace is much more than just another catalogue by bringing a discovery portal straight to the SSH community. Like a library, it acts as a repository for Tools and Services with enriched metadata and making it so much easier to connect people with the resources they need.<br>
    Designed for: The SSH communities of the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC), span- ning students, scholars, junior and senior researchers, as well as resource providers en- abling them to highlight their work.<br>
    Connected communities: The SSH Open Marketplace is embedded within the existing communities of DARIAH, CLARIN, and CESSDA. It cooperates closely with them, while benefiting from the support of other partners like LIBER.</p>

  title: Can Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) be considered as Open Educational
    Resources (OER)?
  description: |-
    <p>Open Education has changed many times over the last decades: After a first boom in the middle of the last century, there was a decline in interest. In our current century, Open Education gained more popularity through the introduction of Open Educational Resources (OER) and Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). Nevertheless, the current focus is different from the past. This article is the start of a series to contribute to a better grasp of the complexity that Open Education is covering. It is a challenge as it is not an empirical article but philosophical argumentation: It discusses the question whether MOOCs can be considered as OER. Open Education and OER can be seen and treated as two strands with different developments even though, in theory, OER belongs to Open Education. Different OER definitions and typologies are analyzed and compared in relation to their dimensions and categorizations. Furthermore, the four conditions and two original types of MOOCs are discussed leading to a debate on their quality. It turns out that there are two perspectives of MOOCs: From the OER point of view, MOOCs as a product can be called an OER if they are fulfilling the OER definition and requirements. From the Open Education point of view, MOOCs are going beyond OER as enablers of Open Education understood as innovative concept and methodology for changing education towards collaborative and moderated learning experiences. That is reflected by the dimensions of the introduced OpenEd Quality Framework and is confirming the need of the two distinctions. Therefore the short answer to our leading question: &quot;Are MOOCs Open Educational Resources?&quot; is: sometimes and it depends from the perspective that you take.</p>

  title: CORBEL Framework in place for launching transnational open user access via
    the common LS (formerly BMS) cluster web portal and RI specific user community
    communication channels
  description: |-
    <p>WP4 has focused on the establishment of common service pipelines between multiple RIs in the biosciences. Via two Open Calls, WP4 identified 37 projects that received support from our service providers and that helped us to test and refine our service offer. We have presented our activities and achievements in this regard already in previous deliverables (especially D4.1 and D4.2) and detail the great impact our users have reported on their scientific output in D4.3 (submitted in parallel). In D4.3, we observe that the Open Calls have enabled cross-cutting interdisciplinary projects, which allow the users to advance in their research and to open new avenues in science. The highly innovative and exploratory nature of the Open Call applications make them a high risk-high reward operation, relying critically on open access programmes and the intense support from LS RI hubs for cross-RI access. All those reports reflected that we achieved the objective of this present deliverable: that we managed to put in place a &ldquo;framework for launching transnational open user access via the common LS RI cluster web portal and RI specific user community communication channels.&rdquo; To secure a leading role for Europe in biomedical research and to ensure the technological support needed for cutting-edge scientific projects, it is indispensable to develop mechanisms that will maintain access to these service pipelines also beyond CORBEL. In this deliverable D4.4, we will therefore highlight those parts of the developed framework that are sustainable and that we will continue to offer and improve, even beyond the CORBEL project. An important aspect of our sustainability plan is the transfer of relevant parts of the CORBEL website to a newly developed Life Science RI website, which will function as single entry point to all LS RIs and which will support the joint presentation of our common activities such as offering cross-RI service pipelines to the outside. We also highlight the development of a joint access management system that was in use during the CORBEL Open Calls and that will continue to be in operation at individual RIs. To increase the visibility of all LS RIs towards the scientific community, funding bodies and other relevant stakeholders, we produced a CORBEL brochure and two videos, both show-casing successful user stories, introducing LS RIs and advertising our joint service portfolio. Future engagement and close cooperation between the LS RIS will be crucial to maintain our established service pipelines across RIs, and in recognition of this responsibility, bilateral Collaboration agreements were signed between INSTRUCT-ERIC and Euro-BioImaging ERIC, EU-OPENSCREEN ERIC and Euro-BioImaging ERIC, EMBRC ERIC and Euro- BioImaging ERIC. Discussions are ongoing between EMBRC ERIC, ELIXIR, Instruct-ERIC, EUOPENSCREEN ERIC and Euro-BioImaging ERIC for further bilateral CAs.</p>

    <p>Those CAs comprise what we consider the most important and relevant activities that should be implemented between the LS RIs, irrespective of currently ongoing cluster projects. Of course, we also encourage the LS RI Strategy Board and EOSC-Life1 to consider implementing some of those activities in their future action plan. The CAs cover various mechanisms of collaboration, such as exchange visits of RI operational and managerial staff or the promotion of the RIs both collectively as well as individually. They also address the need to provide support for user projects interested in making the transition from one RI to the other, and to consider a fast-track for projects previously scientifically evaluated by the other RI. We also encourage developing a strategy for realizing funds for interdisciplinary projects, as the lack of access funding opportunities is a serious bottleneck for many European scientists.</p>

    <p>This deliverable is of the type &lsquo;demonstrator&rsquo;, therefore we will mostly make reference to dedicated material online, accessible via our newly established common Life Science RI website.</p>

  title: Towards Better Practices for the Community Governance of Open Infrastructures
  description: |-
    <p>This report has been created as a research output to support the COPIM project. <a href="https://www.copim.ac.uk/">COPIM</a> (Community-led Open Publication Infrastructures for Monographs) is an international partnership of researchers, universities, librarians, open access book publishers and infrastructure providers. Funded by the <a href="http://re.ukri.org/funding/our-funds-overview/research-england-development-red-fund/">Research England Development (RED) Fund</a> and <a href="https://www.arcadiafund.org.uk/grant-directory?keywords=COPIM">Arcadia</a> &ndash; a charitable fund of Lisbet Rausing and Peter Baldwin &ndash; COPIM is building community-owned, open systems and infrastructures to enable open access (OA) book publishing to flourish.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>As part of seven connected work packages, COPIM will work on 1) integrated capacity-building amongst presses; 2) access to and development of consortial, institutional, and other funding channels; 3) development and piloting of appropriate business models; 4) cost reductions for presses achieved by economies of scale; 5) mutually supportive governance models; 6) integration of OA books into library, repository, and digital learning environments; 7) the re-use of and experimentation with OA books; 8) the effective and robust archiving of OA content; and 9) knowledge transfer to stakeholders through various pilots.</p>

    <p>Work package 4 of the COPIM project is exploring community governance with a view to designing the policies and procedures for community oversight of the infrastructures and models that the overall project is developing. Our aim is to create durable organisational structures for the coordination, governance, and administrative support of the project&rsquo;s community-owned infrastructures. This includes developing new avenues of outreach, communication, and partnership with diverse stakeholders in open research with a shared interest in these infrastructures, enabling community involvement and collective control. In conducting this research, which is reflected in this report as well as in our previous research and reports, we hope both to learn from the governance models that our colleagues in scholarly communication are utilising thus far and to look to the future of community governance for academic publishing.</p>

    <p><strong>Methodology</strong></p>

    <p>The research for this report has been conducted through desk research and draws on and incorporates a literature review of existing research on community governance and the governance of open infrastructures. It follows on from and can be seen as an extension of COPIM&rsquo;s <a href="https://doi.org/10.21428/785a6451.0304a2a8">Exploring Models for Community Governance</a> report, written by Samuel Moore. As the introduction outlines, rather than simply showcasing &lsquo;best practices&rsquo; (though it also does this on occasion) this report looks to plot paths towards <em>better practices</em> for community governance by not shying away from the messiness (Adema, 2014), frictions, and compromises that of necessity come with the governance of open infrastructure in development. Next to that this report outlines the process by which the COPIM project itself has developed its governance structures (mostly in relationship to the project as a whole, and to the <a href="https://copim.pubpub.org/open-book-collective">Open Book Collective</a> (OBC) platform and collective), as a way to be open and transparent about our processes, to showcase in detail what developing community governance might look like in practice, and to document the process of doing so as a resource for the COPIM project itself and for&nbsp; the governance communities of its future infrastructural outputs. This report outlines our processes until early 2022. Current and future developments will be shared and reflected upon as part of a community governance working paper, to be released later in 2022, which includes the rationale behind the OBC&rsquo;s chosen governance structures and policies, and an overview of its governance model and procedures, based also on the research conducted for and gathered in this report. As part of this process of documenting the OBC&rsquo;s governance-in-development we will also be sharing its Articles of Association and other governance documents openly online once we have formally launched the OBC.</p>

    <p>Next to desk research, the findings in this report are also based on a series of both internal and external workshops conducted by COPIM during 2020-2022, which are still ongoing as we finalise the OBC&rsquo;s governance structures and model. The first (external) workshop was conducted in May 2020, and further internal governance workshops have taken place throughout 2021 and 22. The research further draws on informal interviews with COPIM project members on their governance needs. Based on these workshops and interviews several internal documents were created that represent the values, mission, vision statements and governance structures the project aligns itself to. These were developed out of and as part of the workshops through a methodology of co-design (being written in a collaborative manner by the project members) and co-development (being developed in an iterative way, where after each new version input was sought from the project members, both written and orally via workshops, which was subsequently incorporated into a new version). This methodology will be outlined more in depth in the following sections of this report.</p>

    <p>Our thanks go out to our COPIM colleagues for feedback on earlier drafts of this report (with special thanks to WP4 colleagues Eileen Joy, Judith Fathallah, Lidia Uziel, and Tobias Steiner) as well as to the members of COPIM&rsquo;s Community Governance Working Group (with special thanks to Samuel Moore, Marcel LaFlamme, and Leslie Chan), The Next Generation Library Publishing Project, and the participants of our first <a href="https://www.copim.ac.uk/outputs/events/200501-community-governance-workshop/">Community Governance Workshop</a> with external stakeholders.</p>

  title: Quality Reference Framework (QRF) for the Quality of Massive Open Online
    Courses (MOOCs)
  description: "<p>This document contains the <strong>Quality Reference Framework
    (QRF)</strong> developed by the European Alliance for the Quality of Massive Open
    Online Courses (MOOCs), called MOOQ (see: <a href=\"http://www.MOOC-quality.eu\">www.MOOC-quality.eu</a>).</p>\n\n<p>The
    Quality Reference Framework consists of three dimensions:</p>\n\n<p>Dimension
    1: Phases<br>\nDimension 2: Perspectives<br>\nDimension 3: Roles</p>\n\n<p>It
    is most important to note that MOOC designers, facilitators and providers have
    to select the appropriate and relevant phases and processes according to their
    situation, the learning objectives, target groups, context and conditions. Some
    processes are already decided and (partly or completely) defined by pre-conditions
    and requirements (e.g., the available resources, budget and staff).</p>\n\n<p>In
    addition, the Quality Reference Framework provides the <strong>QRF Key Quality
    Criteria</strong> and the <strong>QRF Quality Checklist</strong> for designing
    and developing MOOCs. Main target groups of the Quality Reference Framework are
    the designers, facilitators and providers of MOOCs as well as the MOOC learners.</p>\n\n<p>The
    Quality Reference Framework can be used to analyse the needs and demands for MOOCs,
    to design, develop and implement new MOOCs and to evaluate and improve existing
    MOOCs.</p>\n\n<p>The main benefits of the Quality Reference Framework are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>It
    provides a generic framework that can be adapted to each specific context.</li>\n\t<li>It
    identifies key quality criteria for better orientation on the MOOC design.</li>\n\t<li>It
    presents a checklist for the quality development and evaluation of MOOCs.</li>\n\t<li>It
    enables a continuous improvement cycle for MOOC design and provision.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The
    Quality Reference Framework is based on the International ISO standard ISO/IEC
    40180 (former ISO/IEC 19796-1) and the results from the mixed methods research
    by MOOQ.</p>\n\n<p>MOOQ has achieved huge impact at the local, regional, European
    and international levels: MOOQ could reach out to more than 100,000 MOOC learners,
    designers, facilitators and providers through the MOOQ dissemination and exploitation
    activities.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, in close cooperation with European and international
    institutions and associations, MOOQ could involve in the QRF finalization more
    than 10,000 MOOC learners, designers, facilitators and providers through the Global
    MOOC Quality Survey, the MOOQ presentations and workshops at regional, European
    and international conferences as well as communication and collaboration in traditional
    channels and social media.</p>"

  title: 'Enabling open and reproducible research at computer systems conferences:
    the good, the bad and the ugly'
  description: "<p><em>14 March 2017, CNRS webinar, Grenoble, France</em></p>\n\n<p>A
    decade ago <a href=\"http://fursin.net/research.html\">my research</a> nearly
    stalled. I was investigating how to crowdsource performance analysis and optimization
    of realistic workloads across diverse hardware provided by volunteers and combine
    it with machine learning [1]. Often, it was simply impossible to reproduce crowdsourced
    empirical results and build predictive models due to continuously changing software
    and hardware stacks. Worse still, lack of realistic workloads and representative
    data sets in our community severely limited the usefulness of such models.<br>\n<br>\nAll
    these problems motivated me to create a public portal (<a href=\"http://cTuning.org\">cTuning.org</a>)
    to share, validate and reuse workloads, data sets, tools, experimental results,
    and predictive models while involving the community in this effort [2]. This experience,
    in turn, helped us to initiate the so-called <a href=\"http://ctuning.org/ae\">Artifact
    Evaluation</a> (AE) at ACM conferences on parallel programming, architecture and
    code generation (ASPLOS, CGO, PPoPP, PACT, SC and MLSys). AE aims to independently
    validate experimental results reported in the publications and to encourage code
    and data sharing.</p>\n\n<p>These slides are from my webinar <a href=\"https://github.com/alegrand/RR_webinars/blob/master/8_artifact_evaluation/index.org\"><em>&ldquo;Enabling
    open and reproducible research at computer systems conferences: the good, the
    bad and the ugly&rdquo;</em></a> at CNRS Grenoble (14 March 2017). I shared my
    practical experience organizing Artifact Evaluation over the past years, along
    with encountered problems and possible solutions.<br>\n<br>\nOn the one hand,
    we have received incredible support from the research community, <a href=\"http://acm.org/\">ACM</a>,
    universities, and companies. We have even received a record number of artifact
    submissions at the <a href=\"http://ctuning.org/ae\">CGO/PPoPP&#39;17</a> AE (27
    vs 17 two years ago) sponsored by <a href=\"http://research.nvidia.com/\">NVIDIA</a>
    and the <a href=\"http://ctuning.org/\">cTuning foundation</a>. We have also introduced
    <a href=\"https://github.com/ctuning/ck-artifact-evaluation/blob/master/wfe/artifact-evaluation/templates/ae-20190108.tex\">Artifact
    Appendices</a> and co-authored the new <a href=\"http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-badging\">ACM
    Result and Artifact Review and Badging</a> policy now used at <a href=\"http://sc17.supercomputing.org/submitters/technical-papers/reproducibility-initiatives-for-technical-papers\">Supercomputing</a>.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\nOn
    the other hand, the use of proprietary benchmarks, rare hardware platforms, and
    totally ad-hoc scripts to set up, run and process experiments all place a huge
    burden on evaluators. It is simply too difficult and time-consuming to customize
    and rebuild experimental setups, reuse artifacts and eventually build upon others&rsquo;
    efforts - the main pillars of open science!<br>\n<br>\nI then present <a href=\"http://cknowledge.org/\">Collective
    Knowledge (CK)</a>, my attempt to introduce a customizable workflow framework
    with a unified JSON API and a <a href=\"https://github.com/ctuning/ck/wiki/Portable-workflows\">cross-platform
    package manager</a>, that can automate ML&amp;systems R&amp;D and enable live
    papers while automatically adapting to continuously evolving software and hardware
    [3]. I also demonstrate a practical CK workflow to <a href=\"http://cknowledge.org/ai\">collaboratively
    optimize deep learning</a> across different compilers, libraries, data sets and
    diverse platforms from resource-constrained mobile devices to data centers (see
    our <a href=\"http://cknowledge.org/android-apps.html\">Android app to crowdsource
    DNN optimization</a> across diverse mobile devices provided by volunteers, and
    the <a href=\"http://cknowledge.org/repo-beta\">public repository with results</a>)
    [4].<br>\n<br>\nFinally, I describe our novel publication model to reproduce results
    from published papers with the help of the community [5].&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n<em>Please

  title: UNIVERSITY – INDUSTRY INTERACTION ON KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT THROUGH OPEN INNOVATION
    SYSTEMS
  description: <p>This theoretical paper discusses knowledge management in an open
    innovation systems context on a basis of university &ndash; industry collaboration.
    Knowledge management is necessary to ensure the inbound and outbound flows of
    knowledge that define open innovation, and to ensure that the knowledge, provided
    by the open innovation process ,can be used for successful collaboration between
    universities and industry. The importance of knowledge is emphasized in the literature
    on open innovation, but most modern literature takes only a narrow point of view
    on the problem and is not related to knowledge management through inter-institutional
    collaboration. The paper discusses the General framework conditions for efficient
    university-industry collaboration and in this context, it outlines the Systematic
    procedure of open innovation implementation. The main outlined knowledge flows
    in networking shows a combination of a positive and neutral effect on the effectiveness
    of innovation at the level of business units, which means that open innovation
    within the network is generally beneficial for a multidisciplinary organization
    as well as Incoming innovations across organizational boundaries are beneficial
    for the innovation activity of a business unit, in contrast to outgoing innovations
    that have a neutral effect on it. The ability of organization to recognize the
    value of new external information, absorb and apply it for commercial purposes
    is crucial for its innovative potential. The creation of knowledge and the ability
    to master can be created without a special R&amp;D unit in university - joint
    research and development can be fruitful, and trade areas can provide the opportunity
    for training and joint acquisition of new knowledge.</p>

  title: 'Open Science Drone Toolkit: open source hardware and software for aerial
    data capture'
  description: |-
    <p><strong>Open Science Drone Toolkit: open source hardware and software for aerial data capture</strong></p>

    <p>Despite the increased access to scientific publications and data as a result of open science initiatives, access to scientific tools remains limited. Uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs, or drones) can be a powerful tool for research in disciplines such as agriculture and environmental sciences, but their use in research is currently dominated by proprietary, closed source tools. The objective of this work was to collect, curate, organize and test a set of open source tools for aerial data capture for research purposes. The Open Science Drone Toolkit was built through a collaborative and iterative process by more than 100 people in five countries, and comprises an open-hardware autonomous drone and off-the-shelf hardware, open-source software, and guides and protocols that enable the user to perform all the necessary tasks to obtain aerial data. Performance was evaluated by comparing data obtained with this toolkit over a wheat field to data from satellite imagery and a commercial hand-held sensor, finding a high correlation for both reference instruments. Our results demonstrate the possibility of capturing research-grade aerial data using affordable, accessible, and customizable open source software and hardware, and using open and reproducible workflows.</p>

    <p><strong>Herramientas de c&oacute;digo abierto para la captura de datos a&eacute;reos mediante drones</strong></p>

    <p>A pesar del mayor acceso a publicaciones y datos cient&iacute;ficos como resultado de las iniciativas de ciencia abierta, el acceso a las herramientas cient&iacute;ficas sigue siendo limitado. Los veh&iacute;culos a&eacute;reos no tripulados (VANT o drones) pueden ser una herramienta poderosa para la investigaci&oacute;n en disciplinas como la agricultura y las ciencias ambientales, pero su uso est&aacute; actualmente dominado por herramientas propietarias y de c&oacute;digo cerrado. El objetivo de este trabajo fue recopilar, seleccionar, organizar y evaluar un conjunto de herramientas de c&oacute;digo abierto para la captura de datos a&eacute;reos con fines de investigaci&oacute;n. El &ldquo;Open Science Drone Toolkit&rdquo; fue creado a trav&eacute;s de un proceso colaborativo e iterativo en el que participaron m&aacute;s de 100 personas en cinco pa&iacute;ses,e incluye un dron aut&oacute;nomo de hardware abierto, software de c&oacute;digo abierto, y gu&iacute;as y protocolos que permiten al usuario realizar todas las tareas necesarias para obtener datos a partir de im&aacute;genes a&eacute;reas. Sus resultados se evaluaron comparando los datos obtenidos con este conjunto de herramientas sobre un campo de trigo con datos de im&aacute;genes satelitales y un sensor port&aacute;til comercial, y se encontr&oacute; una alta correlaci&oacute;n para ambos instrumentos de referencia. Estos resultados demuestran la posibilidad de capturar datos a&eacute;reos aptos para su uso en investigaci&oacute;n utilizando software y hardware de c&oacute;digo abierto, asequibles, accesibles y personalizables, y protocolos de trabajo abiertos y reproducibles.</p>

  title: 'Open Access Monographs for Teaching and Research: A Sustainable Model Beyond
    Book Processing Charges'
  description: "<p>This talk introduces the work of the COPIM project (Community-Led
    Infrastructures for Open Access Monographs), then specifically explains the project
    of Work Package 2: Building the Open Book Collective and platform. The OBC will
    host an infrastructure and revenue management platform for the support, access,
    distribution and promotion of OA academic books. Monographs are still of particular
    importance for teaching and research in the arts and humanities especially, and
    OA infrastructures are lagging behind those for journal articles.</p>\n\n<p>The
    Community-led Open Publication Infrastructures for Monographs is an international
    collaborative project bringing together a range of researchers, universities,
    librarians, open access book publishers and infrastructure providers (<a href=\"http://www.copim.ac.uk/\">www.copim.ac.uk</a>).
    One major output of the COPIM project is the Open Book Collective, which is a
    collaboration between librarians, scholarly publishers and OA infrastructure providers.
    We have developed this platform in consultation with librarians, publishers, and
    researchers, via a series of interactive workshops and reflective sessions. The
    Open Book Collective will support a user-friendly, integrated platform to help
    stakeholders explore, discover, access and support OA books from a range of leading
    publishers and infrastructure providers via high-quality integrated metadata and
    a fully searchable catalogue. In a bid to think beyond the Book Processing Charges
    that can sustain inequity in academic publishing, we will to offer a choice of
    flexible subscription packages, through which patrons can choose to support individual
    publishers and schemes, or indeed the entire collective. Whilst our major stakeholders
    will be librarians and publishers, the catalogue and metadata functions will be
    freely available to everyone. We will also be providing space for OA publishers
    to display their current and forthcoming books. Our mission is to build and maintain
    an infrastructure to support the publication, discovery and distribution of OA
    books via a range of flexible subscription packages, and make it easy for OA books
    to be delivered to libraries. We have already partnered with the group of publishers
    that form the ScholarLed collective, with whom we are piloting the platform, but
    are building with the aim of flexible expansion to include more publishers in
    time. We have also partnered with JISC and DOAB, who are assisting in the management
    of revenue, curation, metadata and systems of preservation. In this talk, I will
    discuss the progress of the Collective and platform, and invite stakeholders to
    get involved and join us in this more sustainable and equitable model for publishing
    and distributing open access books. beyond inequitable book processing models.</p>\n\n<p>Resources

  title: 'Digital Humanities and Inclusive Librarianship: Designing a Collaborative,
    Multi-lingual, Skos-compliant Linked Open Vocabulary for LGBTQIA+'
  description: |-
    <p>In simple words digital humanities indicates application of digital tools and<br>
    technologies in the accomplishments of humanities computing, but demands additional<br>
    responsibilities from LIS professionals in ensuring digital inclusiveness and in developing<br>
    collaborative platform for domain modeling in different areas of humanities. This research<br>
    work, in line of the advocacy given by the domain experts, attempts to create a<br>
    collaborative, multilingual, standards compliant linked open vocabulary system for<br>
    LGBTQIA+ domain by the application of open source software and open standards. The<br>
    design part includes two layers &ndash; a) for organizing the Skos-compliant domain-specific<br>
    vocabulary, and b) for providing access to the vocabulary as developed through a Skos-<br>
    compliant browser to support multilingual browsing and searching. The tools and the<br>
    methods adopted to port an existing LGBTQIA+ vocabulary (Homosaurus) into the<br>
    proposed collaborative and multilingual framework are discussed in detail. The<br>
    methodology as demonstrated may be extended to accommodate other domain-specific<br>

  title: Small but sustainable? Scholar-led journals and open access.
  description: |-
    <p>In Germany, stakeholders favour a few strategies to foster open access transformation: Library consortia negotiate (national) licensing models with major publishers; infrastructural service providers focus on flipping journals and therefore cater to the needs of renowned publishing projects. At the same time, for public research funding academic reputation (still) seems a key criterion. In doing so, major advantages of electronic publishing and bibliodiversity are given away, which include supporting innovative publication projects (inter-/transdisciplinary contexts, non-profit models, publications focusing on emerging topics, peripheral-local publication initiatives, small-subject-based initiatives) and developing new publication formats, tools and workflows (community-based and cooperative).</p>

    <p>The project &ldquo;Innovative Open Access in Small Sciences (InnOAccess)&rdquo; (June 2019 - February 2021; funded by the DFG) responds to these challenges by analysing the market of scholar-led, non-APC journals in Germany, developing reusable technical workflows for smaller publishing projects and testing new, interlocking financing models.</p>

    <p>One section of the poster features the results of a survey (sample size = 101) on the state of scholar-led, non-APC journals in Germany: How are they governed, staffed and funded? What are the budgetary options? Here it became clear, for example, that one-size-fits-all solutions do not work, mainly because publication cultures are as different as their publishing institutions. Particularly publishing projects beyond university infrastructures seem to have found creative financing opportunities and technical solutions from which the field of scholar-led-publishing as a whole can profit.</p>

    <p>The poster furthermore outlines, based on the findings of the survey and a systematic evaluation of existing business models, how technical workflows and a modular approach to journal financing contributes to sustainable publishing. This includes a streamlined journal workflow based on open source applications, emphasising cooperative practices and using community-based know-how. Addressing the precarious funding situation of scholar-led, non-APC journals, the poster introduces a set of financing opportunities that have been tested and are deemed manageable with regard to the needs and administrative capacities of this journal segment.</p>

    <p>In total, the poster sheds light on the precarious situation of scholar-led journals in Germany, emphasizes their importance for the open access ecosystem and offers insights on how to improve their situation in a practical fashion.</p>

  title: ASSESSING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF STUDENT RETENTION STRATEGIES AT ZIMBABWE OPEN
    UNIVERSITY
  description: <p>The study aimed at assessing the effectiveness of the student retention
    strategies at the Zimbabwe Open University. It utilised the qualitative approach
    to collect and analyse data. The data was collected through interviews. The study
    sample comprised of sixteen participants, eight staff members and eight students.
    These were selected through purposive sampling since the study was qualitative.
    The findings show that ZOU had very lucrative strategies to manage student retention.
    Among them were management and leadership styles, peer teaching, mentoring and
    collaboration, orientation, and student-centred active learning. It also noted
    that ZOU had challenges in student retention which included resources, social
    influences, soft skills and teaching methods. The study concluded challenges faced
    by students were basically situational not institute based. Teaching methods like
    peer tutoring and collaboration were important as they created a conducive environment
    for learning. The study recommended that ZOU continuously trains its front desk
    employees and equip them with correct information. It was also recommended that
    the students be made aware of the learning styles in an ODL setup before taking
    up the studies.</p>

  title: 7.3 LibChain – Open, Verifiable and Anonymous Access Management
  description: |-
    <p>Current contracts between academic publishers and research libraries are based on subscription models, granting patrons of a library almost unlimited access the digital publications of a single publisher. Unfortunately, pricing models often do not correspond to the usage of the publishers&rsquo; content. As a consequence, several German research libraries canceled their subscription of Elsevier&rsquo;s publications.</p>

    <p>In this paper, we present LibChain, a decentral, verifiable and anonymous access management based on blockchain technology. LibChain envisions a novel procedure to access digital media from different publishers through a library. With the LibChain service, the library stores every request of a digital publication directly in the blockchain, making it an anonymous but verifiable source for publishers to provide access to the user. The decentral blockchain architecture enables new access models for digital media and allows fairer and more accurate pricing models based on the usage.</p>

    <p>LibChain unleashes the full potential if multiple libraries cooperate to create trustworthy usage metrics or share the access to digital publications. As a design principle of the underlying blockchain technology, no mutual trust is required to generate verifiable transactions. We explicitly promote open access publications in our system design by providing verifiable usage metrics among distributed libraries and enable anonymous compensations and donations. In addition to a fully described programming interface for established publishers, we provide a standalone toolkit for conferences and smaller research institutes. Hence, small groups of authors can easily contribute to the LibChain universe and act as their own open access publisher.</p>

    <p>The implementation of our research prototype is based on the open source blockchain framework ethereum. The key advantages of LibChain are: First, it provides a distributed, failure tolerant mechanism for free, open and anonymous access to content that can be used out-of-the-box by anyone. Second, it is compatible to conventional business models, where publishers sell their content for a predefined price. This compatibility is aimed to accelerate the adoption of LibChain by maximising network-external value by integrating the open access and payed publication segments. Third, LibChain provides a reliable way to measure the impact of content and realise payments, since due to its blockchain core, all interactions with LibChain can be verified. Fourth, LibChain balances the access to information relevant to content providers and the privacy needs of users. Given these advantages, LibChain has the potential to accelerate the shift to an open access publication model that provides a robust, distributed content exchange mechanism and substantially higher utility than conventional models to all involved parties.</p>

  title: A Quantitative Study of the Evolution of Open Source Software Communities
  description: |-
    <p>Typically, virtual communities exhibit the well-known<br>
    phenomenon of participation inequality, which means that only a<br>
    small percentage of users is responsible of the majority of<br>
    contributions. However, the sustainability of the community requires<br>
    that the group of active users must be continuously nurtured with new<br>
    users that gain expertise through a participation process. This paper<br>
    analyzes the time evolution of Open Source Software (OSS)<br>
    communities, considering users that join/abandon the community<br>
    over time and several topological properties of the network when<br>
    modeled as a social network. More specifically, the paper analyzes<br>
    the role of those users rejoining the community and their influence in<br>
    the global characteristics of the network.</p>

  title: Non-commercial Open Access to science, the closest approach toward sustainable
    and participatory scholarly communications
  description: |-
    <p>Some lessons should be learnt from the prevailing scholarly communication system which has showed little success in enabling science as a global, participatory and equitable conversation. The Open Access spirit appeared to help but it has not been enough. Instead, ravenous strategies from commercial publishers are transforming reading paywalls into author paywalls. A new exclusionary landscape is emerging.</p>

    <p>The Latin-American region has demonstrated that a science as commons approach is not only feasible but effective in terms of sustainability and inclusivity. It is possible to run journal publishing on a not-for-profit basis and in hands of the academic sector, naturally open to readers and free of APCs. In a cooperative approach where everyone gets benefit from everyone&rsquo;s investment. A distribution of costs among many stakeholders, including universities, academic institutions, governments, national science agencies, hospitals and funders.</p>

    <p>AmeliCA and Redalyc are aimed to preserve the academy-owned, non-commercial publishing by leveraging technologies (AI, semantics) and providing value-added services to contribute to the journals&#39; sustainability and to prevent the adoption of commercial business models. The current collection is composed of more than 1.300 scientific journals and almost 1 million full-text OA articles. The rigorous criteria ensure the quality of the publications available on these platforms and the 10 million articles&rsquo; downloads per month account for the benefit to users worldwide.</p>

    <p>So, it is strategic for the research community, universities, libraries and funders to join forces, as well as share and connect individual and institutional efforts to build a cooperative infrastructure that guarantees both, publishing is led by the scholarly community and its openness could be sustainable. All leveraged with technology to find more effective methods of communication and deployment of the knowledge generated by different regions, disciplinary fields or languages.</p>

  title: 'Biodiversidata: A Collaborative Initiative Towards Open Data Availability
    in Uruguay'
  description: "<p>Data-sharing has become a key component in the modern scientific
    era of large-scale research, with numerous advantages for both data collectors
    and users. However, data-sharing in Uruguay remains neglected given that major
    public sources of biodiversity information (government and academia) are not open-access.
    As a consequence, the patterns and drivers of biodiversity in this country remain
    poorly understood and so does our ability to manage and conserve its biodiversity.
    To overcome this critical gap, collaborative strategies are needed to communicate
    the importance and benefits of data openness, exchange and provide technical tools
    and training on all aspects of data management, sharing practices, focus on incentives,
    and motivation structures for data-holders. Here, we introduce the Biodiversidata
    initiative (www.biodiversidata.org) – a novel Uruguayan Consortium of Biodiversity
    Data. Biodiversidata is a collaboration among experts with the aim of improving
    the country's biodiversity knowledge and the open-access of the vast resources
    they generate. Biodiversidata aims to collate the first comprehensive open-access
    database on Uruguay's whole biodiversity, to support advancements in scientific
    research and conservation actions. Currently, Biodiversidata consists of over
    30 experts from across national and international institutions, studying diverse
    biodiversity groups. After less than two years, we have collected, curated and
    standardised a dataset of ~70,000 records of primary biodiversity data of tetrapod
    species – the first and most comprehensive open biodiversity database ever gathered
    for Uruguay to date. However, the process is hampered by multiple challenges:</p>\n
    \ \n    the lack of support for sampling of specimens and maintenance of collections
    has contributed to the situation were data are often perceived as personal property
    rather than collective resources;\n    institutions have no plans or strategies
    directed to digitisation of their collections which actually places biodiversity
    data in Uruguay 'at risk' of being lost;\n    the scarce governmental and academic
    incentive structures towards open scientific research relegates data-sharing to
    a personal decision;\n    although scientists individually are willing to share
    their research data, the lack of data management plans within their research groups
    hampers the capacity to digitise the data and thus, to make them available;\n
    \   former initiatives aimed to create comprehensive biodiversity databases did
    not consider the balance between openness and gain for researchers, setting the
    subject of data-sharing more of an obligation than a path of promotion, which
    impacted negatively in the perception of scientist to open their data.\n  \n  <p>To
    overcome some of these challenges, we decided to direct Biodiversidata to individual
    researchers/experts and not institutions. We called them with the plan of collecting
    the maximum possible amount of data from vertebrate, invertebrate and plant species,
    use it to collaboratively generate impactful scientific research. An important
    aspect was that we requested data only to fit the premise of being primary biodiversity
    data (i.e., data records that document the occurrence of a species in space and
    time). This meant cleaning and standardising very heterogeneous information, from
    a variety of source types and formats, including updating scientific names and
    georeferentiating sampling locations. However, centralising the cleaning process
    allowed researchers to send their raw records without spending time cleaning them
    themselves and, as a consequence, enlarged the amount of data being collated.
    Collectively, Biodiversidata's approach towards changing the culture of data-sharing
    practices has relied on the reinforcement of a scientific collaboration culture
    that benefits not only researchers at the individual level, but the progress of
    larger-scale issues as a whole. There is a long way to go on the subject of open
    research data in Uruguay, though, aiming strategies to people, capitalising data
    management and progressing with step-by-step rewards, is already showing some
    preliminary encouraging results.</p>"

  title: 'Lifting Industrial Ecology Modeling to a New Level of Quality and Transparency:
    A Call for More Transparent Publications and a Collaborative Open Source Software
    Framework'
  description: '<p>Industrial ecology (IE) is a maturing scientific discipline. The
    field is becoming more data and computation intensive, which requires IE researchers
    to develop scientific software to tackle novel research questions. We review the
    current state of software programming and use in our field and find challenges
    regarding transparency, reproducibility, reusability, and ease of collaboration.
    Our response to that problem is fourfold: First, we propose how existing general
    principles for the development of good scientific software could be implemented
    in IE and related fields. Second, we argue that collaborating on open source software
    could make IE research more productive and increase its quality, and we present
    guidelines for the development and distribution of such software. Third, we call
    for stricter requirements regarding general access to the source code used to
    produce research results and scientific claims published in the IE literature.
    Fourth, we describe a set of open source modules for standard IE modeling tasks
    that represent our first attempt at turning our recommendations into practice.
    We introduce a Python toolbox for IE that includes the life cycle assessment (LCA)
    framework Brightway2, the ecospold2matrix module that parses unallocated data
    in ecospold format, the pySUT and pymrio modules for building and analyzing multiregion
    input-output models and supply and use tables, and the dynamic_stock_model class
    for dynamic stock modeling. Widespread use of open access software can, at the
    same time, increase quality, transparency, and reproducibility of IE research.</p>'

  title: Towards an Open Research Knowledge Graph
  description: |-
    <p>The document-oriented workflows in science have reached (or already exceeded) the limits of adequacy as highlighted for example by recent discussions on the increasing proliferation of scientific literature and the reproducibility crisis. Despite an improved and digital access to scientific publications in the last decades, the exchange of scholarly knowledge continues to be primarily document-based: Researchers produce essays and articles that are made available in online and offline publication media as roughly granular text documents. With current developments in areas such as knowledge representation, semantic search, human-machine interaction, natural language processing, and artificial intelligence, it is possible to completely rethink this dominant paradigm of document-centered knowledge exchange and transform it into knowledge-based information flows by representing and expressing knowledge through semantically rich, interlinked knowledge graphs.<br>
    The core of the establishment of knowledge-based information flows is the distributed, decentralized, collaborative creation and evolution of information models, vocabularies, ontologies, and knowledge graphs for the establishment of a common understanding of data and information between the various stakeholders as well as the integration of these technologies into the infrastructure and processes of search and knowledge exchange in the research library of the future. By integrating these information models into existing and new research infrastructure services, the information structures that are currently still implicit and deeply hidden in documents can be made explicit and directly usable. This revolutionizes scientific work because information and research results can be seamlessly interlinked with each other and better mapped to complex information needs. As a result, scientific work becomes more effective and efficient, since results become directly comparable and easier to reuse.<br>
    In order to realize the vision of knowledge-based information flows in scholarly communication, comprehensive long-term technological infrastructure development and accompanying research are required. To secure information sovereignty, it is also of paramount importance to science &ndash; and urgency to science policymakers &ndash; that scientific infrastructures establish an open counterweight to emerging commercial developments in this area. The aim of this position paper is to facilitate the discussion on requirements, design decisions and a minimum viable product for an Open Research Knowledge Graph infrastructure. TIB aims to start developing this infrastructure in an open collaboration with interested partner organizations and individuals.</p>

    the impact of usage and satisfaction level of users. The response was 73%, and
    analysis revealed that 94% of the respondents use arXiv. The study showed that
    more than 50% contribute to arXiv and that they are highly satisfied with the
    use of this resource. Further, the study has also shown that, by contributing
    to arXiv, the researchers benefited from significant impacts, such as getting
    good feedback, collaborations, and an increase in the number of citations. We
    believe that this study will encourage researchers to use and contribute to OA
    resources and also motivate libraries to promote OA repositories.</p>

  title: 'DaRWIN: An open source natural history collections data management system'
  description: |-
    <p>DaRWIN (Data Research Warehouse Information Network) is an in-house solution developed by the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences (RBINS), as a Natural History collections management system for biological and geological samples in collections. In 2014, the Royal Museum for Central Africa (RMCA) adopted this system for its collections and started to take part in new developments.</p>
      <p>The DaRWIN database currently manages information on more than 600,000 records (about 4 million specimens) housed at the RBINS and more than 650,000 records (more than 1 million specimens) at the RMCA.</p>
      <p>DaRWIN is an open source system, consisting of a PostgreSQL database and a customizable web-interface based on the Symfony framework (https://symfony.com).</p>
      <p>DaRWIN is divided into 2 parts:</p>
      <ul>
        one public section that gives a "read-only" access to digitised specimens,
        one section for registered users, with different levels of access rights (user, encoder, conservator and administrator), customizable for each collection and allowing update of specimens and collections, daily management of collections, and the potential for dealing with sensitive information.
      </ul>
      <p>DaRWIN stores sample data and related information such as place and date of collection, missions and collectors, identifiers, technicians involved, taxonomy, identification information (type, stage, state, etc.), bibliography, related files, storage, etc. Other features that deal with day-to-day curation operations are available: loans, printing of labels for storage, statistics and reporting. DaRWIN features its own JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) webservice for specimens and scientific names and can export data in tab-delimited, Excel, PDF and GeoJSON formats.</p>
      <p>More recently, a procedure for importing batches of data has been developed, based on tab-delimited files, making integration of data from (old/historical) databases faster and more controlled.</p>
      <p>Additional improvements of the user interface and database model have been made. For example, parallel taxonomical hierarchies can be created, allowing users to work with temporary taxonomies, old scientific names (basionyms and synonyms) and document the history of type specimens.</p>
      <p>Finally, quality control and data cleaning on several tables have been implemented, e.g. mapping of locality names with vocabularies like Geonames, adding ISO 3166 two-letter country codes (https://www.iso.org/iso-3166-country-codes.html), cleaning duplicates from people/institutions and taxonomy catalogues. A tool for checking taxonomical names on GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility), WoRMS (World Register of Marine Species) and DaRWIN itself, based on webservices and tab-delimited files, has been developed.</p>
      <p>Last year, RBINS, RMCA and Meise Botanic Garden (MBG) defined a new framework of collaboration in the NaturalHeritage project (http://www.naturalheritage.be), in order to foster interoperability among their collection data sources. This new framework presents itself as one common research portal for data on natural history collections (from DaRWIN and other existing collection databases) of the three partnered institutions and makes data compliant to a standard agreed by the partners. See Poster "NaturalHeritage: Bridging Belgian Natural History Collections" for more information.</p>
      <p>DaRWIN is accessible online (http://darwin.naturalsciences.be). A Github repository is also available (https://github.com/naturalsciences/natural_heritage_darwin).</p>

  title: Use of European Open Science Cloud and National e-Infrastructures for the
    Long-Term Storage of Digitised Assets from Natural History Collections
  description: |-
    <p>Digitisation of Natural History Collections (NHC) has evolved from transcription of specimen catalogues in databases to web portals providing access to data, digital images, and 3D models of specimens. These portals increase global accessibility to specimens and help preserve the physical specimens by reducing their handling. The size of the NHC requires developing high-throughput digitisation workflows, as well as research into novel acquisition systems, image standardisation, curation, preservation, and publishing. Nowadays, herbarium sheet digitisation workflows (and fast digitisation stations) can digitise up to 6,000 specimens per day. Operating those digitisation stations in parallel, can increase the digitisation capacity. The high-resolution images obtained from these specimens, and their volume require substantial bandwidth,&nbsp;and disk space and tapes for storage of original digitised materials, as well as availability of computational processing resources for generating derivatives, information extraction, and publishing. While large institutions have dedicated digitisation teams that manage the whole workflow from acquisition to publishing, other institutions cannot dedicate resources to support all digitisation activities, in particular long-term storage. National and European e-infrastructures can provide an alternative solution by supporting different parts of the digitisation workflows. In the context of the Innovation and consolidation for large scale digitisation of natural heritage (ICEDIG Project 2018), three different e-infrastructures providing long-term storage have been analysed through three pilot studies: EUDAT-CINES, Zenodo, and National Infrastructures.</p>

    <p>The EUDAT-CINES pilot centred on transferring large digitised herbarium collections from the National Museum of Natural History France (MNHN) to the storage infrastructure provided by the Centre Informatique National de l&#39;Enseignement Sup&eacute;rieur (CINES 2014), a European trusted digital repository. The upload, processing, and access services are supported by a combination of services provided by the European Collaborative Data Infrastructure (EUDAT CDI 2019) and CINES . The Zenodo pilot included the upload of herbarium collections from Meise Botanic Garden (APM) and other European herbaria into the Zenodo repository (Zenodo 2019). The upload, processing and access services are supported by Zenodo services, accessed by APM. The National Infrastructures pilot facilitated the upload of digital assets derived from specimens of herbarium and entomology collections held at the Finnish Museum of Natural History (LUOMUS) into the Finnish Biodiversity Information Facility (FinBIF 2019). This pilot concentrates on simplifying the integration of digitisation facilities to Finnish national e-infrastructures, using services developed by LUOMUS to access FinBIF resources.</p>

    <p>The data models employed in the pilots allow defining data schemas according to the types of collection and specimen images stored. For EUDAT-CINES, data were composed of the specimen data and its business metadata (those the institution making the deposit, in this case MNHN, considers relevant for the data objects being stored), enhanced by archiving metadata, added during the archiving process (institution, licensing, identifiers, project, archiving date, etc). EUDAT uses ePIC identifiers (ePIC 2019) to identify each deposit. The Zenodo pilot was designed to allow defining specimen data and metadata supporting indexing and access to resources. Zenodo uses DataCite Digital Object Identifiers (DOI) and the underlying data types as the main identifiers for the resources, augmented with fields based on standard TDWG vocabularies. FinBIF compiles Finnish biodiversity information to one single service for open access sharing. In FinBIF, HTTP URI based identifiers are used for all data, which link the specimen data with other information, such as images.</p>

    <p>The pilot infrastructure design reports describe features, capacities, functions and costs for each model, in three specific contexts are relevant for the implementation of the Distributed Systems of Scientific Collections (DiSSCo 2019) research infrastructure, informing the options for long-term storage and archiving digitised specimen data. The explored options allow preservation of assets and support easy access. In a wider context, the results provide a template for service evaluation in the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC 2019) which can guide similar efforts.&nbsp;</p>

  title: Vegetation classification goes open access
  description: '<p>With this inaugural editorial, we introduce Vegetation Classification
    and Survey (VCS), the new gold open access (OA) journal of the International Association
    for Vegetation Science (IAVS). VCS is devoted to vegetation classification at
    any spatial and organisational scale and irrespective of the methodological approach.
    It welcomes equally case studies and broad-scale syntheses as well as conceptual
    and methodological papers. Two Permanent Collections deal with ecoinformatics
    (including the standardised Database Reports published in collaboration with GIVD,
    the Global Index of Vegetation-Plot Databases) and phytosociological nomenclature
    (edited in collaboration with the respective IAVS Working Group). We discuss the
    advantages of OA as well as challenges and drawbacks caused by the way it is currently
    implemented, namely "pay for flaws" and publication impediments for scientists
    without access to funding. Being a society-owned journal, editorial decisions
    in VCS are free from economic considerations, while at the same time IAVS offers
    significant reductions to article processing charges (APCs) for authors with financial
    constraints. However, it is recognised that sustainable OA publishing will require
    that payment systems are changed from author-paid APCs to contracts between the
    science funding agencies and publishers or learned societies, to cover the production
    costs of journals that meet both quality and impact criteria.</p>        <p>          Abbreviations:

  title: CORBEL Report on impact of integrated access standards tested for open user
    access
  description: |-
    <p>The mission of this WP is to support advanced user projects in need of a diverse set of technologies and services thereby enabling cutting-edge research. WP4 has focused on offering shared life science services by establishing common service pipelines between multiple ESFRI Life Science Research Infrastructures (LS RI). Pipelines between service providers were refined in several rounds, starting with VIP projects, then opening up the services to the general scientific community via two Open Calls.</p>

    <p>This deliverable demonstrates the impact that the establishment of common service pipelines between multiple LS RIs has generated - for the user, for the RI, and for the scientific community. The Open Calls have given broad visibility to the RIs and have attracted genuinely new user groups to RI services and have thereby also increased the user-base of the individual RI. The Open Calls have enabled cross-cutting interdisciplinary projects, which allow the users to advance in their research and to open new avenues in science. The highly innovative and exploratory nature of the Open Call applications make them a high risk-high reward operation. As exploring new technologies with uncertain outcomes is not likely funded in individual research grants, open access programmes and the intense support from LS RI hubs for cross-RI access become critical. Further, the Open Calls have exposed that transnational access to research data from human participants is challenging and a significant bottleneck. Due to the Coronavirus pandemic at present 75% of 2nd Open Call projects got interrupted and have not been able to complete their visits yet.</p>

    <p>To secure a leading role for Europe in life science research and to ensure the technological support needed for cutting-edge scientific projects, it is indispensable to develop mechanisms that will maintain access to these service pipelines also beyond CORBEL. To this end, the LS RIs maintain opportunities for cross-RI access via bilateral collaboration agreements and joint calls and work closely together in the cluster to explore opportunities for future calls across RIs with funders and deepen the alignment to include the full project life cycle including FAIR data and analysis via EOSC.</p>

  title: Strengthening South-South Cooperation for Advancing Open Access in India
    & South Asia
  description: |-
    <p>A year after the Budapest Open Access Initiative (<a href="https://www.budapestopenaccessinitiative.org/">BOAI</a>) was released in 2002, the seeds of the Open Access movement were sown in India. However, the momentum had not gained as it has should have been in the country and in the region, South Asia when compared to Europe and Latin America. In the recent past, with the initiatives of the individuals, communities of practice, institutes and the funding agencies (both private and public) there was an acceleration in the progress of Open Access. The countries, especially in South Asia <em>viz</em>., <a href="http://www.openaccessbd.org/">Bangladesh</a>, <a href="http://openaccessindia.org/">India</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/OANepal/">Nepal</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/category/Education/Open-Access-Pakistan-165430990675048/">Pakistan</a>, <a href="https://www.sljol.info/">Sri Lanka</a> etc., have now communities of practice advocating for Open Access to the public funded research. And this region now has policies and infrastructures in place for opening up access to the public funded research. For example, in India, the <a href="http://www.dst.gov.in/sites/default/files/APPROVED%20OPEN%20ACCESS%20POLICY-DBT%26DST%2812.12.2014%29_1.pdf">Department of Biotechnology and Department of Science and Technology</a>, Government of India, <a href="http://www.csircentral.net/mandate.pdf">Council of Scientific and Industrial Research</a>, <a href="https://icar.org.in/node/5542">Indian Council of Agricultural Research</a> has adopted policies for Open Access and had also made available suitable infrastructure. It is now mandatory for all the doctoral degree scholars to deposit their thesis as per the directive of the <a href="https://www.ugc.ac.in/pdfnews/3562709_letterformphilphdthesis.pdf">Ministry of Human Resources Development</a>, Government of India. Efforts are also being made to deliver all the openly available resources through a single platform called <a href="https://ndl.iitkgp.ac.in/">National Digital Library of India</a>. However, there is no mandatory national policy formulated by any of the countries in South Asia.</p>

    <p>While there is no problem in deposition of the whole or part of the thesis by the scholars in a publicly available repository, the deposition of journal articles along with or without data in public repositories has had some conflict. Still, researchers and the research managers of the institutes or universities are not clear about the legal issues of sharing the research outputs immediately. There is a very low filling of the repositories with full-texts in India even when there is a policy and infrastructure in place. The possible reasons for the low populating rate of articles in the repositories is that though the policies are in place, there are no rewarding/incentive mechanisms for openly sharing the research outputs and due to copyright transfer agreements. And the research, evaluation and monitoring committees in the universities or institutes solely depend upon publications in the journal impact factors.</p>

    <p>As availability of the relevant journals with higher impact factors from the South Asian countries are limited in numbers and also have a high rejection rate. By publicizing fake metrics, large number of questionable journals are coming up and are luring the scholars to submit articles to their publications. These journals are questionable journals which publish without any review, but for a charge. The scholars are taking this road in order to publish in numbers and in no time. Though the availability of quality articles via repositories is less, the availability of same via open access journals is much more.</p>

    <p><a href="https://agrixiv.org/jb2d7/">The scholarly societies in India</a>, though trying to catch up with the technology due to the traditional character of publication in print journals, there is a huge time lag from submission to publication. Some of the societies are collaborating with the commercial for profit publishers for online publications and are not able to provide immediate free access to the published articles due to embargo.</p>

    <p>The efforts by the University Grants Commission for building a white list of journals and the rating of the journals by another academy can be seen as quality control mechanisms in scholarly publications. But more efforts are needed for making Open Access as default by 2030. The <a href="https://doaj.org/">DOAJ</a> ambassadors in India are also working with the applications for indexing and are also raising the awareness on Quality Open Access Journals.</p>

    <p>To put forth the alternate pathway for sharing the research outputs for public to read and review it as soon as possible and also to cut short the long time gap in the publication process while giving the priority of work published, preprint repositories are becoming popular and gaining importance in the scholarly communication process across all the disciplines which was earlier confined to physics only. The Open Access India a community of practice advocating for Open Access, Open Data and Open Education, had launched a preprint repository exclusively for agriculture and allied sciences, <a href="https://agrixiv.org/">AgriXiv</a> with the help of the <a href="https://cos.io/">Centre for Open Science</a>. Now similar to <a href="https://blog.scielo.org/en/2018/09/21/pkp-and-scielo-announce-development-of-open-source-preprint-server-system/">SciELO Preprints</a> and other regional preprint, the Open Access India is planning to launch <a href="https://www.facebook.com/indiarxiv">IndiaRxiv</a> for all the disciplines and for all the scholarly outputs in preprint stage in the country, India.</p>

    <p>Recently the advocates and practitioners of Open Access in India had pounced &lsquo;<a href="http://openaccessindia.org/delhi-declaration-on-open-access/">Delhi Declaration on Open Access</a>&rsquo; to commemorate the BOAI which was adopted sixteen years ago. The signatories of the declaration were not only of India, but the other countries in the South. This shows the concern and solidarity for the Open Access initiatives by the Global South constituents. The communities of practice in South Asia under the initiative of Open Access India are planning for the formation of the <a href="https://opensouthasia.wordpress.com/">regional Open Access forum</a> on the similar lines of Latin America.</p>

    <p>The South Asian region has more lessons to learn from the <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/blog/why-open-access-publishing-growing-latin-america">Open Access movement in Latin America</a>. The success stories and the strategies from Latin America along with the successful research sharing, evaluation, monitoring and rewarding mechanisms are very crucial learning resources for the development of a regional cooperation for Open Access policy and infrastructure development in South Asia.</p>

  title: Free and Open Software in Polish enterprises
  description: |-
    <p>The growing use of information technologies in the global economy, including also the Polish one, prompts to carry out in-depth economic analyses of this process. One of its aspects, which deserves a special attention, is the possibility to exploit the Free and Open Source Software (FOSS). Its appearance has not only changed the picture of the relevant segment of the teleinformation market but also has grown to the rank of essential problem of the contemporary economic analyses.</p>

    <p>There are numbers of studies trying to carry out a description of the Free and Open Source Software and seeking for confirmation for the theories being constructed. However, there is lack of analyses, which would concern potential and real possibilities of use of FOSS in the economic practice, especially in private businesses, and, at the same time, be based on substantial findings of the contemporary microeconomy in this field. To play such a role there serves the presented monograph, whose objective is to show how Polish economic entities make use in their activities of the Free and Open Source Software, what are the reasons for the ascertained state of affairs and what is the influence in the subject matter of use of FOSS of the decisions being made on their effectiveness, competitiveness and innovativeness.</p>

    <p>The book is an effect of implementation of the research project &ldquo;Impact of the use of the Free and Open Source Software on Polish enterprises&rsquo; competitiveness&rdquo;, carried out in the Enterprise Competitiveness Unit of the Institute for Market, Consumption and Business Cycles Research in Warsaw in the years 2010-2011. The research team comprised: Paweł Dziewulski, Wanda Karpińska-Mizielińska, Grzegorz Konat, Anna Skowronek-Mielczarek and Tadeusz Smuga (project manager).</p>

    <p>The book consists of two parts. The first part includes three chapters constituting the theoretical backgrounds for the conducted empirical studies. The first chapter, whose author is Anna Skowronek-Mielczarek, focuses on the importance of use of information and communication technologies for enterprises&rsquo; innovativeness and competitiveness. In the second chapter, Grzegorz Konat presents the introduction to the analysis of the Free and Open Source Software as an economic phenomenon, defining it and pointing out to the motives of creation of FOSS and its macro- and microeconomic dimensions. In the third chapter, Paweł Dziewulski focuses on effectiveness of the markets and economies making use of the Free and Open Source Software.</p>

    <p>The carried out in this part of the study analysis of decisions of economic entities on the use of FOSS shows that the scale of the application of this software depends, first of all, on effectiveness of its use in production processes. Occurrence of high economies of scale as well as network effects may lead to dominance of this type of software in firms&rsquo; activities, even when the difference in costs between the proprietary software and FOSS is not big. At the same time, enterprises&rsquo; decisions as regards the type of information system being used strongly depend on the scale of activity being carried out, and they may alter with its growth.</p>

    <p>The second part of the monograph is of an empirical nature and presents the results of surveys carried out at enterprises and in public institutions. The authors thereof are: Paweł Dziewulski, Wanda Karpińska-Mizielińska, Grzegorz Konat and Tadeusz Smuga. It is divided into five chapters where there are presented, subsequently: the methodology of research and features of the random sample, the decision-making processes as regards the use and exploitation of hardware and software, ways of acquisition and exploitation of IT systems, determinants, barriers and consequences of the use of Free and Open Source Software as well as impact of FOSS exploitation on the change in efficacy of functioning of the enterprises surveyed and their competitive position in the market.</p>

    <p>It is ascertained that the use of Free Open Source Software is conducive to improvement of efficiency (efficacy) of functioning, first of all, of those economic entities, in which: (i) employment does not exceed 250 people; (ii) in the period of three last years, the use of FOSS did not change or increased; (iii) computers are used in their basic (statutory) activities or in the process of management; (iv) there is a separated IT cell; (v) decisions on the choice of software are made by the management or employees themselves; (vi) FOSS is used because of the conviction of its greater security or when it is considered as sufficient for the entity&rsquo;s needs despite the reservations as to its quality, and (vii) there do not occur barriers in the form of employees&rsquo; suggestions not to use FOSS, insufficient knowledge among the users or lack of open equivalents for the proprietary solutions needed by the entity.</p>

    <p>The deliberations contained in the book are summarised by the conclusions whose authors are the entire research team.</p>

  title: What do we mean by "data" in the arts and humanities? Final Dissertation
    in Open Science
  description: |-
    <p>This dissertation describes the interviews we conducted in late 2021 with 1 representative for each of the 19 disciplinary areas within the department of Classical Philology and Italian Studies (FICLIT) at the University of Bologna. The answers we gathered from participants were analysed using the Grounded Theory method and allowed us to reflect on the definition of the word &ldquo;data&rdquo; in the humanities domain, what research materials should be considered to fall within this definition, and what researchers in this field think of the term. In addition, we gathered information on other aspects of research, such as methodologies, possible copyright and privacy concerns, preservation strategies, and more.</p>

    <p>First, we extracted a list of 16 research materials that constitute the &ldquo;building blocks&rdquo; of research in the humanities, as far as our interviewees are concerned; publications emerged as the most important one. The majority of participants included most of the materials they use in research within their definition of data, and this term did not seem to be especially problematic for them, contrary to what has been reported elsewhere. Most researchers also stated they have a precise methodology, although rarely formalised, which is surprising when compared to the available literature. Regarding data management practices, our results mostly confirm what emerged from previous studies, but collaboration was a notable exception: sharing with colleagues, and teamwork appear more common than reported elsewhere. Finally, the attitudes towards open science and open data are mostly positive among the interviewees.</p>

    <p>The study should be replicated on a larger scale, and include other disciplines, to confirm these findings and paint a more precise picture of how research is done in the humanities and how it can be made more FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable and re-usable).</p>

  title: 'Open Hardware: A key for accelerating science and technology towards the
    U.N. Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)'
  description: |-
    <p>On June 1st of 2021, members of the Gathering for Open Science Hardware (GOSH) community convened a virtual writing workshop for promoting Open Source Hardware (OScH) at the international policy level (you can read more about this workshops in a blog post <a href="https://openhardware.science/2021/06/14/policy-session-supporting-open-hardware-international-expansion/">here</a>). Workshop participants included OScH practitioners and those with international policy backgrounds from across the globe. The resulting policy brief highlights the potential for innovation that OScH brings on the international level and how international organizations can best promote OScH practices.</p>

    <p><strong><em>Key Messages</em></strong></p>

    <p>1. International organisations and governments can increase their innovation capacity towards the SDGs by adopting and promoting open hardware.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>2. Open hardware can build innovation capacity in countries with low investments in science, technology and innovation, making these investments more efficient.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>3. Open hardware enables new multi-stakeholder partnerships and collaborations between academia, civil society and the private sector, towards the SDGs.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>4. Open hardware adoption makes science more transparent and participative, supporting global decentralised collaboration.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>5. International organisations can promote open hardware expansion by incorporating open hardware (OH) in their strategies, aligning incentives and raising awareness through education and training.</p>

  title: 'Open Source Software and Union Catalogues: A Case Study of Creating a Union
    Catalogue of FORSA Libraries at the National Level'
  description: <p>Scientific Serials are considered as a backbone for research in
    any field and hence it is imperative to know the availability of it. An attempt
    has been made to create union catalogue of scientific serials at various levels,
    but it is found that, it is very difficult to keep the information up- to -date.
    In this paper attempt has been made to create union catalogue of FORSA libraries
    with the help of open source software tools like MySql and PHP scripting language.
    This online catalogue has been simplified in such a way that individual libraries
    can keep their serials holdings up-to -date on a central server. This paper may
    open a new way of collaboration through partnership to share the resources among
    distributed observatories.</p>

  title: SCINDR - The SCience INtroDuction Robot that will Connect Open Scientists
  description: |-
    This project will develop a way to connect, in real time, globally disparate researchers who are doing similar science so that they can work better and faster towards the development of new medicines.

    The scientific literature already fulfills the role of notifying researchers about work that has been done, and social media has recently evolved to alert researchers to what is being done. While these new communication technologies simplify the collaborative process between widely distributed researchers, there still exists a major gap in efficient real time alerting and updating. We aim to automate an alert process so that, as a researcher records what they are doing in a natural way, they are immediately alerted to others around the world in real time who are working on related science.

    Our system is built on the conceptual model of the machine understanding of human-generated content, used by social media platforms to generate alerts to further relevant content. The system we propose to build will understand the molecular information being recorded in a scientist's notebook. It will then search both its own records and others in the public domain in order to introduce scientists where there may be mutual advantage - when two laboratories are working on similar molecules, assays or approaches, for example. To achieve this, we will build on a recently developed open source electronic lab notebook (ELN) to create the required component - the automated alerting service we call the SCience INtroDuction Robot, or SCINDR.

    We foresee wide application of SCINDR in chemical and biological research because it will accelerate research by connecting people. In so doing, SCINDR will provide the incentive for others to take their research into the public domain (Fig. 1).

    for open source lessons'
  description: |-
    <p>The Carpentries teaches software and data skills to researchers and librarians all over the world. Our Instructor Training program promotes good teaching practices, grounded in research findings in educational psychology. Certified Instructors teach lessons developed and maintained by the community in short-format workshops. These lessons are developed in open source repositories and published online with a permissive CC-BY license.</p>

    <p>The Carpentries Incubator was created to provide a space for the community to collaborate on the development and testing of new lessons. The Incubator contains more than 100 lesson repositories, at various different stages of the lesson life cycle, teaching a wide range of skills relevant to RSEs, including workflow management, statistics and deep learning, and MRI data analysis. Community members collaborate to create new lessons, and teach and provide feedback on those that have reached later stages of maturity.</p>

    <p>The Carpentries Lab provides a space for the community to perform open peer review of these lessons, curating a collection of accessible, high-quality community-developed lessons that Instructors can be confident are ready to adopt and teach to their audience. In collaboration with The Journal of Open Source Education (JOSE), the Lab provides a mechanism for peer review to result in journal publication credit for lesson developers.</p>

  title: Unpacking the openness of open evaluations
  description: '<p>The proposed paper discusses open evaluation in the context of
    two fields of knowledge-intensive &ldquo;production&rdquo; that are in varied
    ways and to varied degrees based on &ldquo;openness&rdquo; themselves: scientific
    publishing and peer2peer production (maker movement). The paper starts with the
    outline of a rough evolutionary perspective that provides a heuristic to compare
    various &ldquo;open&rdquo; processes of knowledge production, providing a meta-.
    We then outline the notion of open evalu-ation and explore two &#39;open evaluation&#39;
    examples in order to illustrate the current multifacetedness of open evaluation.
    For a more theoretically informed exploration, we link open evaluation with theory-driven
    evalua-tion, participatory evaluation and Weick&#39;s (1989) description of theory
    building as disciplined imagination. Unpacking the term &#39;open evaluation&#39;
    is likely to generate a conceptually rich picture of considerations to support
    designers of open evaluations who aim for an open evaluation approach. More concretely,
    the paper will discuss benefits and risks in open evaluations and point towards
    an evolutionary process in refining and consolidating open evaluation principles
    as a result of open collaboration.</p>'

  title: 'Open exchange of scientific knowledge and European copyright: The case of
    biodiversity information'
  description: <p><b>Background. </b>The 7th Framework Programme for Research and
    Technological Development is helping the European to prepare for an integrative
    system for intelligent management of biodiversity knowledge. The infrastructure
    that is envisaged and that will be further developed within the Programme “Horizon
    2020” aims to provide open and free access to taxonomic information to anyone
    with a requirement for biodiversity data, without the need for individual consent
    of other persons or institutions. Open and free access to information will foster
    the re-use and improve the quality of data, will accelerate research, and will
    promote new types of research. Progress towards the goal of free and open access
    to content is hampered by numerous technical, economic, sociological, legal, and
    other factors. The present article addresses barriers to the open exchange of
    biodiversity knowledge that arise from European laws, in particular European legislation
    on copyright and database protection rights.</p><p>We present a legal point of
    view as to what will be needed to bring distributed information together and facilitate
    its re-use by data mining, integration into semantic knowledge systems, and similar
    techniques. We address exceptions and limitations of copyright or database protection
    within Europe, and we point to the importance of data use agreements. We illustrate
    how exceptions and limitations have been transformed into national legislations
    within some European states to create inconsistencies that impede access to biodiversity
    information.</p><p><b>Conclusions</b>. The legal situation within the EU is unsatisfactory
    because there are inconsistencies among states that hamper the deployment of an
    open biodiversity knowledge management system. Scientists within the EU who work
    with copyright protected works or with protected databases have to be aware of
    regulations that vary from country to country. This is a major stumbling block
    to international collaboration and is an impediment to the open exchange of biodiversity
    knowledge. Such differences should be removed by unifying exceptions and limitations
    for research purposes in a binding, Europe-wide regulation.</p>

  description: |-
    <p>The article presents the results of an empirical study carried out within the &ldquo;Open Research Platform&rdquo; (ORP) subproject of &ldquo;European Collaborative and Open regional Innovation Strategies&rdquo; (EURIS). In the frame of this subproject a survey was carried out to investigate companies&rsquo; technology transfer practices with universities in four regions of the European Union, i.e. Navarra (Spain), Lodz region (Poland), Stuttgart region (Germany) and Western-Transdanubia (Hungary). The main objectives of the investigation were to explore: i) to what extent knowledge transfer activities at higher education institutions and research organizations serve the open innovation model? and ii) what the role is of higher education institutions in the technology transfer system of the examined regions?<br>
    In the first section, the relevance of the survey under the open innovation paradigm is discussed then the main conclusions of the survey are presented. Finally, an open innovation collaboration model is introduced that provides both companies and universities with some suggestions to make their collaboration more effective</p>

  title: How can we sustain open access publishing in a cooperative way?
  description: |-
    <p>The sustainability of open access publishing infrastructures and initiatives is becoming increasingly important as open access as a modus operandi of scientific publishing is gaining in importance.</p>

    <p>For reasons of efficiency and innovation, it is imperative that the scientific publication system remains in the hands of the scientific community, supported by learned societies and libraries. The variant of APC-based business models is accordingly viewed very critically and also contradicts the approach of cooperative action. While there are successful non-APC open access publishing models, they are not properly addressed in open access policies and often invisible to researchers.</p>

    <p>OpenAIRE organized a workshop last February to bring the EU and international community together and to learn from each other on this topic. Here, strengths and weaknesses of different approaches have been analysed and practical experiences were presented and discussed, eg. about consortial models, other cost sharing and sustainability strategies.</p>

    <p>The aim of the workshop was not only to assess the risks using SWOT analysis, to collect best practices on the establishment and operation of non-APC open access publication initiatives, but also to find conclusions on how to adapt open access policies and support mechanisms, if necessary, in order to foster non-APC based models with a long-term perspective.</p>

    <p>The results of the workshop will now culminate in a roadmap towards sustainability for non-APC publishing targeting policy makers, funders, higher education and research institutions and learned societies providing recommendations for collective and non-APC open access publishing actions.</p>

    Indonesia could dominate in all but the third index. In Scopus, the journals in
    the region averaged below the global averages of all bibliometric indicators but
    Scholarly Output. Despite this, three countries were above the global average
    in eight indicators. Over 40% of the 98 journals were ranked in Quartile 2.Such
    a marked contrast between the number of journals indexed in the second index and

  title: 'How COVID-19 has an impact on formal education: A collective international
    evaluation of open education in distance learning'
  description: '<p>While causing unprecedented disruption worldwide, COVID-19 has
    also stimulated the mainstreaming of digital technologies in the delivery of formal
    education. For most key stakeholders &ndash; organisations, educators, and students
    &ndash; this has been a new and challenging experience and has been described
    in policy terms as &lsquo;emergency remote education&rsquo;. For many students,
    however, it has either exacerbated or marginalised their opportunity to access
    formal education. In probing this impact at a deeper level, an international collaboration
    involving the authors during 2020-2021 focused on reviewing contemporary practices
    and potentials of open education as a strategic and sustainable response. This
    paper highlights practices, case studies, and emerging issues from 13 diverse
    countries, to be globally representative, which include: Australia, Brazil, France,
    India, Mexico, the Netherlands, Nigeria, Spain, Sweden, South Korea, Taiwan, Turkey,
    and the United Kingdom. This collection of countries was selected based on researcher
    contexts and contributions. To date, findings indicate open education has demonstrable
    benefits for distance learning. More broadly, open educational practices are positioned
    to shape a &lsquo;new normal&rsquo; that embraces &lsquo;global citizenship&rsquo;
    while also being equitable and inclusive. Our aspirations are that such practices
    will lead to better formal education promoting and ensuring human rights, democracy,
    lifelong learning, safety, social justice, diversity, cultural sensitivity and
    inclusivity through strategic and long-term support by all stakeholders in both
    modes of educational delivery and access: face-to-face and distance learning.</p>'

  title: 'Community-led Open Publication Infrastructures for Monographs (COPIM): Annual
    Report - Year 2 (2020-2021)'
  description: "<p>COPIM is committed to exploring solutions to some of the most pressing
    barriers currently preventing small publishers from interfacing with large-scale
    organisations and processes. As a result, COPIM is developing a significantly
    enriched, not-for-profit and open-source ecosystem for open access (OA) book publishing;
    one that will support and sustain a diversity of publishing initiatives and models,
    particularly within Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS) publishing.</p>\n\n<p>The
    adoption of alternative infrastructures, business models, preservation structures,
    and governance procedures, all to be scoped and developed through COPIM, will
    enable increased economic resilience and enhanced capacities for the publication
    and dissemination of open access books at smaller and larger scales. COPIM&#39;s
    approach offers Higher Education institutions and HSS researchers sustainable
    publishing models that they control, increased publishing options, and new revenue
    streams and cost reductions, designed to help build a more equitable horizontal
    and co-operative knowledge sharing community.</p>\n\n<p>During the second year
    of the project, COPIM has continued its work in the areas of collaborative research,
    infrastructure development, project management and outreach and community building.
    Further evolving its approach to cope with the continued and compounding challenges
    that the COVID-19 pandemic and Brexit have offered to the Higher Education sector
    and beyond, the project has succeeded in meeting the vast majority of its deliverables
    and milestones across all work packages, in some areas even outperforming the
    initial goals set.</p>\n\n<p>The list of key output and activities delivered includes
    the:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>publication of six new major scoping reports</strong>;</li>\n\t<li>successful
    organisation and documentation of <strong>15 workshops overall</strong> with <strong>more
    than 190 national and international high-profile stakeholders</strong> <strong>representing
    22 countries</strong></li>\n\t<li>set-up and iterative extension of an <strong>Outreach
    and Dissemination network</strong> that is combining a variety of channels including
    social media and open community platforms;</li>\n\t<li>beta launch and continuous
    further development of <a href=\"https://thoth.pub\"><strong>Thoth</strong></a>,
    COPIM&rsquo;s Open Dissemination System. Thoth now makes <strong>open access book
    metadata</strong> available in an open, transparent, and participatory way. It
    will see further integration into the larger context of the <strong>Open Book
    Collective</strong>, among other outlets, to be developed in Year 3 and beyond.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The
    COPIM project has continued and deepened its engagement with the work packages&rsquo;
    variety of stakeholders (i.e., librarians, publishers, researchers, technology
    providers, and the general public), bringing together key experts and those interested
    in learning more about scholar-led, not-for-profit, OA book publishing. Alongside
    its own event organisation and outreach activities, COPIM has been involved in
    the <a href=\"https://openaccessbooksnetwork.hcommons.org/\"><em>Open Access Book
    Network</em></a>, while COPIM team members have been invited to participate in
    a variety of external conferences, events, and networks by organisations and projects

    plan during this second year is particularly noteworthy as the project had to
    work with the continued and compounding effects of the various challenges that
    COPIM saw in its first-year set-up. As already outlined during the first year
    Brexit and the pandemic &ndash; and the systemic effects these events continue
    to have on the Higher Education sector as a whole &ndash; governed much of the

  title: Open, multiple, adjunct. Decision support at the time of Relational AI
  description: '<p>In this paper, we consider some key characteristics that relational
    AI should exhibit to enable decision hybrid agencies that include subject-matter
    experts and their AI-enabled decision aids, especially when these latter ones
    have been developed by following a machine learning approach. We will hint at
    the design requirements of guaranteeing that AI tools are: open, multiple, continuous,
    cautious, vague, analogical and, most importantly, adjunct with respect to decision
    making practices. We will argue that especially adjunction is an important condition
    to design for. Adjunction entails the design and evaluation of human-AI interaction
    protocols aimed at improving AI usability, that is decision effectiveness and
    efficiency, while also guaranteeing user satisfaction and human and social sustainability,
    as well as mitigating the risk of automation bias, technology over-reliance and
    user deskilling. These high-level aims are compatible with the tenets of a relational
    approach to the design of AI tools to support decision making and collaborative
    practices.</p>'

  title: 'Diversity, inclusion and collaboration: A critical open knowledge perspective'
  description: '<p>When universities need to address strategic issues, they increasingly
    demand data to support decisions. With equity, diversity and inclusion (EDI) high
    on the agenda for universities and governments, at least in the Anglophone North,
    there is a growing amount of data available. This data tells a largely depressing
    story of limited progress. But there is more to this story than might first appear.
    Decisions about whether or not to collect data about EDI; and the terms that are
    used to describe the aspects of diversity considered relevant to a specific national
    or institutional context may have as much to tell us about the geographies of
    our EDI conversations as the data itself. Taking a critical perspective to the
    data available can help us to identify differing priorities and concerns in various
    contexts. This presentation draws on the very large data set that has been gathered
    as part of the Curtin Open Knowledge Initiative: tens of trillions of data points
    relating to research communication, open access, collaboration and diversity.
    Outside the Anglophone North ethnic diversity and minority inclusion as understood
    in the West is not always a priority, and although gender equity may be an intention,
    outcomes indicate great disparities in some countries. Similarly we can compare
    rhetoric on diversity and inclusion (for example in Annual reports) with actual
    performance, not just identifying a gap, but seeing how that gap is related to
    prestige and resources. Using our model of Open Knowledge Institutions, this talk
    will examine both what the available data tells us, and what it cannot tell us,
    and in turn, what that tells us.</p>'

  title: FAIR and open multilingual clinical trials in Wikidata and Wikipedia
  description: <p>This project seeks to conduct language translation on metadata labels
    for research publications, attribution data, and clinical trials information to
    make data about medical research queriable in underserved languages through Wikidata
    and the Linked Open Web. This project has the benefit of distributing content
    through Wikipedia and Wikidata, which already have an annual userbase of a billion
    users and which already have established actionable standards to practice diversity,
    inclusion, openness, FAIRness, and transparency about program development. The
    impact will be localized access to basic research information in various Global
    South languages to integrate with existing community efforts for establishing
    the same. Although Wikidata development in this direction seems inevitable, the
    cultural and social exchange required to establish global multilingual research
    partnerships could begin now with support rather than later as a second phase
    effort for including the developing world. Wikipedia and Wikidata are established
    forums with an existing active userbase for multilingual research collaboration,
    but the research practices there still are immature. By applying metadata expertise
    through this project, we will elevate the current amateur development with more
    stable Linked Open Data compatibility to English language databases. Using the
    wiki distribution and discussion platform to develop the global conversation about
    data sharing will set good precedents for the trend of global research collaboration.</p>

  title: PHEMTRONICS Open Research Data Pilot- Data Management Plan
  description: |-
    <p>This deliverable presents the first version of the PHEMTRONICS Data Management Plan (DMP). PHEMTRONICS participates in Open Research Data (ORD) Pilot, and, therefore, is providing, as requested, the current deliverable six months after the beginning of the project (M6, November 2020).</p>

    <p>The DMP is not a fixed document, but it is likely to evolve during the whole lifespan of the project, serving as a working document. This document will be updated as needed during the Project General Assemblies.<br>
    The purpose of the DMP is to contribute to good data handling through indicating what research data the project expects to generate and describe which parts of the data that can be shared with the public.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, it gives instructions on naming conventions, metadata structure, storing of the research data and how to make public data available.<br>
    During the 36 active months of the project, a SharePoint in the private area of the PHEMTRONICS website will be used as the online working and collaboration platform. SharePoint is only accessible to project partners and can provide further access control through establishing folders and sub-sites with stricter access granted than to the main site.</p>

    <p>During the project all public datasets will be uploaded to this site and stored in accordance with the privacy strategy of PHEMTRONICS.<br>
    PHEMTRONICS will use the open research data repository Zenodo to comply with the Horizon 2020 Open Access Mandate. This mandate applies to the underlying research data of publications, but beneficiaries can also voluntarily make other datasets open.</p>

    <p>In PHEMTRONICS, all deliverables, publications and PUBLIC datasets will be uploaded to the European Commission Funded Research (OpenAIRE) Community in Zenodo. Uploads will be done upon approval of the deliverables by the European Commission, upon publication or acceptance of scientific publications, or, for underlying datasets, at the end of the project at the latest.</p>

    <p>Each dataset will be given a persistent identifier (Digital Object Identifier, DOI), supplied with relevant metadata and linked to the project name and grant agreement number.<br>
    The DMP is a living document and will be updated during the project. The next version of the DMP will put a strong emphasis on the complete definition of procedures to be implemented by the project to efficiently manage its research data in terms of storage and backup (backup provision, recovery procedure), selection and preservation (which data will be retained/shared/ preserved, length of time data to be preserved and preservation preparation time). At the end of the project to reflect the actual research data generated during the project and include updated instructions for how to access open data.</p>

    <p>The maintenance is the responsibility of the Project Coordinator, supported by the Data Controllers.</p>

  title: Making photocatalysis comparable using a modular and characterized open source
    photoreactor
  description: <p>Reproducibility and comparability of photocatalytic experiments
    are still challenging, owing to the large number of experimental parameters and
    their comprehensive documentation. To overcome this limitation, a modular, adaptable,
    and extensible photoreactor platform is reported, which enables experiments under
    well-characterized, reproducible conditions. Comparability is ensured by comprehensive
    photonic characterization with chemical actinometry and radiometry and open documentation
    of the incident photon fluxes in the reaction vessels for different setups as
    well as the homogeneity of irradiation in multi-reactor setups. Comprehensive
    documentation minimizes the need of repeated photonic characterization when modifying
    the setups. Experimental reproducibility within and across experiments was evaluated
    with studies of photocatalytic systems for hydrogen evolution, emphasizing the
    validity of the concept.</p>

  title: 'Resource Allocation in Multiuser Multi-Carrier Cognitive Radio Network via
    Game and Supermarket Game Theory: Survey, Tutorial, and Open Research Directions'
  description: |-
    <p>In this tutorial, we integrate the concept of cognitive radio technology into game theory and supermarket game theory to address the problem of resource allocation in multiuser multicarrier cognitive radio networks. In addition, multiuser multicarrier transmission technique is chosen as a candidate to study the resource allocation problem via game and supermarket game theory. This<br />
    tutorial also includes various definitions, scenarios and examples related to (i) game theory (including both non-cooperative and cooperative games), (ii) supermarket game theory (including pricing, auction theory and oligopoly markets), and (iii) resource allocation in multicarrier techniques. Thus, interested readers can better understand the main tools that allow them to model<br />
    the resource allocation problem in multicarrier networks via game and supermarket game theory.<br />
    In this tutorial article, we first review the most fundamental concepts and architectures of CRNs and subsequently introduce the concepts of game theory, supermarket game theory and common solution to game models such as the Nash equilibrium and the Nash bargaining solution. Finally, a list of related studies is highlighted and compared in this tutorial.</p>

  title: Open Source Workshop to Mobilize Marine Biodiversity Data
  description: <p>The 2022 Marine Biological Data Mobilization Workshop was a collaborative
    effort between Ocean Biodiversity Information System-USA (OBIS-USA), Marine Biodiversity
    Observation Network, Hakai Institute, Integrated Ocean Observing System, and Ocean
    Tracking Network, and hosted to promote open data and software in marine biodiversity
    assessment. The workshop focused on the application of the Darwin Core data standard
    (Wieczorek et al. 2012) to extant data and the subsequent publication of data
    to the open access data infrastructures provided by OBIS and the Global Biodiversity
    Information Facility. The curriculum for this workshop was modeled using The Carpentries
    evidence-based best practices of teaching. The materials and website are openly
    available via GitHub and are free for re-use or adaptation under an MIT license.
    Some unconventional features of the workshop included:</p>Much of the workshop
    time was allocated to breakout rooms and individual work.The use of concurrent,
    topical breakout rooms led by instructors in combination with "floating" specialist
    volunteers.A 100% open and free virtual workshop leveraging synchronous and asynchronous
    communications technologies including Slack, Zoom, and GitHub.All instructional
    steps were offered in both Python and R (dual-programming language materials).<p>The
    workshop was attended internationally by 63 participants, with 48 attendees joining
    the associated Slack group. These new members have been invited to attend a monthly
    working group organized to address roadblocks to standardization and promote the
    mobilization of marine biological data. A pre- versus post-survey analysis showed
    substantial improvement to self-reported data science skill levels, a multitude
    of positive feedback was reported, and the workshop scored a perfect 100% standard
    Net Promoter Score (Reichheld 2003) with 16 "promoters", 0 "detractors", and a
    total of 25 respondents.</p>

  title: 'Technical editing: Scientific Journals and Open Science'
  description: <p>These notes present a basic overview of the most relevant aspects
    of the role of scientific journals in open science; for the review, the definition
    of open science established by the European Union forum is examined. The given
    concept covers many areas of academic society; furthermore, open science is supported
    by open data, open source, open access, and open review. It has a clear, free,
    discovered, broad and expeditious methodology; with open sources in software and
    hardware that allow the entire community greater accessibility. The purpose of
    open science is the production of public scientific goods through the exchange
    of results and collaboration. The characteristics that a scientific journal and
    its repositories should have are carefully analyzed; as well as, the contradictions
    in society in the face of open science policies are also studied. The advances
    of open science in Venezuela are also presented. To conclude that the goal of
    open science is to promote communication between researchers in an area of knowledge
    and enable scientific knowledge to reach broader sectors of society for technological
    development.</p>

  title: Feasibility study Open Knowledge Base
  description: |-
    <p>Commissioned by the VSNU (the Association of Universities in the Netherlands) and the Dutch Taskforce on Responsible Management of Research Information and Data (click <a href="https://www.vsnu.nl/files/documenten/Domeinen/Onderzoek/Open%20access/Engelstalige%20samenvatting%20opdracht%20werkgroep.pdf">here</a> for more information about the taskforce) we investigate the feasibility of a so-called Open Knowledge Base. At the moment, Dutch universities and knowledge institutions each individually keep records of the activities of their own researchers. This may involve publications (journals, books, conferences, etc.), datasets, grants, but also collaboration partners. However, the (CRIS-)systems of the various institutions are not linked, each institution consequently only has insight into its own activities and cannot see this in a broader context. For example, it is a challenge for researchers who change universities several times to construct an integrated overview of their own activities. Another example is that it is a challenge to get a (good) overview of all Dutch research activities in a given domain. The VSNU and the taskforce are investigating whether it is possible to develop a national infrastructure in which such information can be maintained and enriched, so that services can be developed that could make the above questions, among others, possible.</p>

    <p>Dialogic has investigated the characteristics of such an infrastructure, also known as an Open Knowledge Base, and the consequences of design choices for development and maintenance costs, the quality and usability of metadata, and the positioning of the Netherlands in the international research community. We conclude that an Open Knowledge Base is both desirable and technologically feasible.</p>

    Proudman presents the results of &lsquo;The Diamond Open Access Study&rsquo;,
    a research study commissioned by cOAlition S. In her presentation, a new understanding
    of the OA Diamond sector and its maturity with respect to editorial quality assurance
    practices and Plan S technical requirements will be shared. Additionally, she
    will discuss key perceived challenges of OA Diamond journal editors and the current
    financial sustainability of the sector. Most importantly, she will be presenting
    the new OA publishing Commons, which seeks to bring together the world&rsquo;s
    community-driven/governed journals and platforms, connect them and technically
    support them in a new, increasingly coordinated and sustainable way.<br>\nNext,
    Natalia Grygierczyk discusses an innovative model for Diamond Open Access scientific
    publishing, explaining not just its theoretical foundations, but also how it is
    actually implemented in the newly started OA Radboud University Press (OA RUP).
    Within the new cooperative model, the OA RUP aims to enable, guide, and support
    academic editorial boards in the transition process to Diamond Open Access. This
    presentation provides an overview of the new publishing model, its operational
    activities, and financial aspects. It concretely describes the collaborative process
    with various service providers, how the OA RUP is financially sustainable in the
    long term and how cost-effectiveness is achieved in the transition to Open Access.<br>\nFinally,
    Rebecca Wojturska provides insight into the world of launching a library-based
    Open Access book-hosting service. The presentation will reflect on the timeline,
    successes and learning points of the current University of Edinburgh library project
    and provide recommendations and conclusions to attendees. It will also discuss
    how to grow a book-hosting service and how it is useful in supporting teaching
    and learning. Finally, it will consider the technical requirements of such a project
    and share anecdotal evidence from academic and student users to document the successes
    of the University of Edinburgh library project and launch. As such, the primary
    audience for this presentation is the librarian who is beginning their own book-hosting
    service, or who is considering it, as well as those interested in Open Access
    publishing.</p>"

  title: Nurturing a sustainable Open Tree of Life
  description: <p>The Open Tree of Life project is a collaborative effort to synthesize,
    share and update a comprehensive tree of life Fig. 1. We have completed a draft
    synthesis of a tree summarizing digitally available taxonomic and phylogenetic
    knowledge for all 2.6 million named species, available at tree.opentreeoflife.org
    Hinchliff et al. 2015. . . This tree provides ready access to phylogenetic information
    which can link together biodiversity data on the basis of what we know about relevant
    evolutionary history. Both the unified reference taxonomy Rees and Cranston 2017
    and the published phylogenetic statements underlying the tree McTavish et al.
    2015 are available and accessible online. Taxa in the phylogenies are mapped to
    the the reference taxonomy, which aligns Open Tree taxon identifiers to those
    from NCBI and GBIF, among several other taxonomy resources. The synthesis tree
    is revised as new data become available, and captures conflict and consensus across
    different published phylogenetic estimates. This undertaking requires both development
    of novel infrastructure and analysis tools, as well as community engagement with
    the Open Tree of Life project. I will discuss the challenges in and the progress
    towards achieving these goals.</p>

  title: SOME IMPORTANT ISSUES IN FREE AND OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE
  description: <p>In 1983 Richard Stallman founded the free software movement. According
    to the founder this type of software respects user’s freedom and social solidarity
    of development team called community in FOSS terminology. Whereas proprietary
    softwares take away the user’s freedom and keep the users helpless. In free and
    open source software the concept of sharing the source code is used. Here all
    the participants are connected through internet. FOSS has grown now in a full
    fledged software development methodology thruought the world. This methodology
    cuts down or reduces the cost of software. Also no country of the world wants
    to waste crores of rupees on softwares which are proprietary as they have an option
    to divert to this new category of software. But all want to be safe by getting
    acquainted with various issues related with free and open source software. Therefore
    the main aim of this article is to highlight the important issues related with
    free and open source software</p>

  title: A New Research Economy: Socio-technical framework to open up lines of credit
    in the academic community
  description: <p>Journal articles have been the gold standard for research and scholarly
    communication. Specifically, measurements of publication and citation, particularly
    in high-impact journals, have long been the key means of accruing credit for researchers.
    In turn, these credits become the currency through which researchers acquire funding
    and achieve professional success. But, like global trade, tying in to a fixed
    standard limits wealth distribution and innovation.  It is time for the research
    community to attribute credit for contributions that reflect and drive collaborative
    innovation, rewarding behaviors that produce better research outcomes.</p>

  title: Empirical Analysis of the Reusability of  Object-Oriented Program Code in
    Open-Source Software
  description: <p>Measuring the reusability of Object-Oriented (OO) program code is
    important to ensure a successful and timely adaptation and integration of the
    reused code in new software projects. It has become even more relevant with the
    availability of huge amounts of open-source projects. Reuse saves cost, increases
    the speed of development and improves software reliability. Measuring this reusability
    is not s straight forward process due to the variety of metrics and qualities
    linked to software reuse and the lack of comprehensive empirical studies to support
    the proposed metrics or models. In this paper, a conceptual model is proposed
    to measure the reusability of OO program code. A comprehensive set of metrics
    is used to compute the most significant factors of reusability and an empirical
    investigation is conducted to measure the reusability of the classes of randomly
    selected open-source Java projects. Additionally, the impact of using inner and
    anonymous classes on the reusability of their enclosing classes is assessed. The
    results obtained are thoroughly analyzed to identify the factors behind lack of
    reusability in open-source OO program code and the impact of nesting on it.</p>

  title: 'Open Source Agriculture: Grassroots Technology in the Digital Era'
  description: |-
    <p>I have spent most of my life (so far) in and around a farm in one of the most remote and&nbsp; poor areas of Greece. Being surrounded by farmers and people working in the primary&nbsp; and basic construction sector, I had not appreciated the ingenuity and collaborative effort&nbsp; these people put in their day to day activities to achieve sustainability. It was not until I had spent several years away from my family homes that it dawned on me how&nbsp; uncritically immersed urbanised societies were in the technology they are handed.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>I had always been enamoured with information and communication technologies. I was experimenting with free and open source software and tinkering with hardware to get my work done affordably and to have control over the digital technologies. But I came to&nbsp; understand that the open source is something beyond an efficient approach to hi-tech. It&nbsp; is a social movement.</p>

    <p>Openness, sharing resources, and other terms like these are used today to add a &ldquo;sexiness&rdquo;&nbsp; factor to products or institutions that do not deserve the name. This has led to the term&nbsp; &ldquo;openwashing&rdquo; (borrowed from &ldquo;greenwashing&rdquo;) to call out this trend. Similarly,&nbsp; participatory or user-driven design, co-creation or co-construction and other concepts&nbsp; have been proposed to include the public or at least some diversity of stakeholders in the&nbsp; technology development. However, such initiatives, mostly externally driven, are often&nbsp; organised top-down and do not essentially involve citizens. Hence, the dichotomy is&nbsp; maintained between expert and layman ignoring the social complexities of stakeholder&nbsp; engagement.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>This book explores those initiatives that have been self-mobilised from within farmer&nbsp; communities, in a bottom-up fashion, and are engaging in technology development for&nbsp; the community itself. The practical lessons learned from this research project are being&nbsp; applied in our efforts to provide the local community, where I grew up, with the tools to&nbsp; formulate an effective organisation similar to the ones I discuss here.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>This book explores technology designed and produced by farmers to accommodate their&nbsp; particular needs. I trace the emergence of a new social movement that facilitates and promotes this type of technology. I thus discuss two case studies of social movement&nbsp; organisations and their technological communities: the Farm Hack network in the US&Alpha;&nbsp; and the L&#39;Atelier Paysan initiative in France. The focus is on how they frame their&nbsp; activities and how this translates in the alternative technology development model. I use&nbsp; the following conceptual tools: Framing analysis and resource mobilisation theory from&nbsp; the social movement research field; and the constructivist approach and critical theory of&nbsp; technology from the technology research field.</p>

    <p>This book illustrates how individuals refuse to embrace a technological system of&nbsp; mainstream agriculture that does not reflect their values and interests, and instead rely on&nbsp; alternative framings of technological culture to give meaning to their vision of how&nbsp; agriculture should be. By doing so, I address a novel collaborative mode of technology&nbsp; production, substantially different from the dominant market-driven one.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>I employ the concept of the social movement to describe this collective activity, albeit in&nbsp; an early stage. This enables the tracing of the various ideological frames that contribute&nbsp; to the creation of a common set of principles and goals for those engaging in this activity&nbsp; as well as their efforts to gain support. That is why framing analysis has been selected as&nbsp; a key theoretical approach, combined with an investigation of the incentivising and&nbsp; resource management processes within the movement organisations.</p>

    <p>I also examine the details of the production process in the broader sociotechnical&nbsp; environment. I argue that this emerging mode of production signals a break from the&nbsp; capitalist mode of technology production and formulates a more democratised alternative.&nbsp;</p>

    the whole AI/SW/HW stack in terms of speed, accuracy, energy consumption, size,

    we are simply destined to drown in the ever growing number of design choices,
    system<br>\nfeatures and conflicting optimisation goals.<br>\n<br>\nWe present
    our novel community-driven approach to solve the above problems. Originating from
    natural sciences, this approach is embodied in Collective Knowledge (CK), our
    open-source cross-platform workflow framework and repository for automatic, collaborative
    and reproducible experimentation. CK helps organize, unify and share representative
    workloads, data sets, AI frameworks, libraries, compilers, scripts, models and
    other artifacts as customizable and reusable components with a common JSON API.<br>\n<br>\nCK
    helps bring academia, industry and end-users together to gradually expose optimisation
    choices at all levels (e.g. from parameterized models and algorithmic skeletons
    to compiler flags and hardware configurations) and autotune them across diverse
    inputs and platforms. Optimization knowledge gets continuously aggregated in public
    or private repositories such as cKnowledge.org/repo in a reproducible way, and
    can be then mined and extrapolated to predict better AI algorithm choices, compiler
    transformations and hardware designs.<br>\n<br>\nWe also demonstrate how we use
    this approach in practice together with ARM and other companies to adapt to a
    Cambrian AI/SW/HW explosion by creating an open repository of reusable AI artifacts,
    and then collaboratively optimising and co-designing the whole deep learning stack
    (software, hardware and models).</p>"

  title: A COAR Case Studies – National Licenses and Open Access in Germany
  description: |-
    <p>Over the last years, a number of collaborative negotiations have taken place at a national level in order to push forward on conditions for Open Access within journal license agreements. In 2010, the National Licensing working group of the &ldquo;Digital Information&rdquo; initiative in Germany agreed on common guidelines and carried out licensing negotiations for current journals and databases. Spe-<br>
    cial attention was paid to pricing models, archiving and &lsquo;moving wall&rsquo; conditions, including a condition for Open Access. The background to and outcomes of these negotiations are described in this paper, with particular emphasis on newly agreed licenses in the Alliance of German Science<br>

  title: Open reliability information database
  description: |-
    <p>Analysing and predicting system performance and availability depends largely upon reliability&nbsp;and maintenance data. Attaining statistically credible data can require observations from several years of operations. Fortunately, this data collection process can be quickened if this data&nbsp;is shared within the community of organisations in the same working domain.</p>

    <p>The goal of this task is to develop an open reliability information system to provide a common platform for storing and sharing reliability information on components in the area of energy&nbsp;management. The work is accompanied by a prototyping activity that shall prove the concept&nbsp;and create a foundation for gathering reliability information about selected key systems. A&nbsp;special care is taken to ensure technical efficiency and meeting the legal and administrative&nbsp;constraints emerging from cooperation with industrial partners and regulatory bodies.</p>

    <p>The open reliability information systems focuses on industrial infrastructures in large scale facilities. The shared data will consist of system and subsystem reliability and maintenance&nbsp;statistics, information on system structure and operation conditions as well as estimation on&nbsp;data quality. The data will be used in quantitative reliability and availability assessments. The&nbsp;stored data and intended use differ from traditional maintenance databases that are used for&nbsp;storing individual equipment failure events.</p>

    <p>The development of an open reliability database started in the context of the Future Circular Collider - Cern (FCC) research project, where a platform for sharing reliability information&nbsp;played a big role in the area of accelerator technology and this community did not have a platform yet. However, successful examples of this concept exist in oil, nuclear and wind power&nbsp;industries and this existing knowledge shall be used to benefit this project. This knowledge&nbsp;includes OREDA, EIReDA, SPARTA and WInD-Pool projects and ISO 6527, ISO 14224 and&nbsp;ISO/TR 12489 standards.</p>

  description: |-
    <p>This report tackles a simple question: how can open access books be more successfully integrated into scholarly libraries? While there are some important practical efforts being made to address this question in a variety of different contexts, we explore the areas where further work is required to progress from a situation in which supporting and integrating open access books often remains a peripheral concern for libraries.</p>

    <p>The report draws on desk research alongside a combination of interviews, workshop discussions and pre-workshop surveys with librarians and individuals involved in library consortia. It explores issues such as the discoverability of open access content in library catalogues, the sustainability of open access monograph publishing, the difficulty of articulating the value of open access for supporting universities and the challenge of aligning open access values with those of stakeholders. It also reimagines a more diverse and inclusive system of scholarly communication in relation to open access monographs. As part of this, the report outlines some of the principles that could inform a new open access model/platform aimed at transforming the relationship between open access book publishers and libraries.</p>

  title: An open source part cost estimation tool for MDO purposes
  description: |-
    <p>Within Multi-Disciplinary Optimization (MDO), multiple disciplines of a part or product are evaluated in<br>
    order to determine the performance in these disciplines . Manufacturing cost is not a discipline usually<br>
    evaluated in an MDO analysis. However for aircraft part and component manufacturers manufacturing cost<br>
    is one of the most important performance indicators because it directly affects the profitability of such<br>
    companies. Cost is often not included because no cost evaluation tool is available. In this paper a cost estimation tool is presented that relates geometric features to recurring manufacturing cost. The tool uses only data from the public domain and will be open source to ensure anyone can use it, improve it and include manufacturing<br>
    cost in their MDO frameworks.</p>

  title: The role of management support for the implementation of open innovation
    practices in firms
  description: <p>Open innovation (OI) has gained a lot of popularity in the last
    decade, as sharing research and innovation efforts offer several benefits for
    firms and industries. However, implementing a successful OI environment within
    firms has several internal and external challenges. Therefore, researchers are
    investigating the factors that might contribute to achieving a successful OI adoption.
    This paper investigates the effect of management support on the successful adoption
    of OI. The paper uses regression techniques with data from an OI survey that was
    conducted in Europe in 2014. Respondents, from several countries and industries,
    were asked to evaluate their firm&#39;s current OI adoption level, as well as,
    several internal competencies. The dataset analysis results showed that there
    is a positive correlation between management support of OI and the possibility
    of successful adoption of OI. Moreover, the results offered insight on some of
    the dynamics of how management support affect OI adoption.</p>

    <p>This paper aims to address the quality issues of open online education and learning with a focus on MOOCs. Specifically, our research goal is to develop a Quality Reference Framework (QRF) with quality indicators and tools in close collaboration with all interested stakeholders worldwide. Based on a rigorous literature review and analysis of existing quality approaches and quality indicators for MOOCs, the Global MOOC Quality Survey was designed targeting at three core interest groups: MOOC learners, MOOC designers and MOOC facilitators. A total of n=267 took part in the survey. The survey results were complemented with 45 semi-structured interviews with MOOC designers, facilitators and providers. This mixed method research was selected to provide a more coherent picture and analysis of the quality issues of MOOCs by investigating them from diverse and different perspectives. This paper presents first results from the survey and semi-structured interviews, the first QRF draft and the feedback gained from workshops at international conferences.</p>

  title: '8.3 A Library-Publisher Partnership for Open Access: Building an Innovative
    Relationship between Scholarly Publishers and Academic Libraries'
  description: |-
    <p>As the importance of open access continues to grow, there remains no clear consensus on the ideal model to sustain scholarly publishing while making content openly accessible. Can a solution be found that meets the needs of both the scholarly publishers and university libraries? The &Eacute;rudit Consortium and the Canadian Research Knowledge Network (CRKN) are exploring one solution to this challenge through a strategic partnership that supports the move towards open access for Canadian francophone scholarly journals.</p>

    <p>CRKN and &Eacute;rudit have had a relationship through a traditional commercial subscription model since 2008. In 2014 the two organisations recognised the need for a new relationship that would address two major challenges: the fragility of the Canadian scholarly publishing environment and the increasing pressure from libraries and funding agencies for scholarly journals to move towards open access.</p>

    <p>&Eacute;rudit and CRKN have worked collaboratively to create an innovative partnership, which provides a framework for a new relationship between publishers and libraries, and helps to provide financial support to Canadian publishers during the transition to a fully open access model.</p>

    <p>The paper presents the perspectives of the two organisations involved in the partnership, outlining the common goals, objectives, and strategy, as well as the differing needs and perspectives of libraries and publishers. It will summarise the steps taken to achieve this partnership, the success factors, the challenges faced, and the next steps in moving the project ahead. In addition, the paper will provide insight for other organisations which may be seeking to address similar challenges in a collaborative fashion.</p>

  title: 'Neurokernel: An Open Scalable Software Framework for Emulation and Validation
    of Drosophila Brain Models on Multiple GPUs'
  description: <p>The brain of the fruit fly <em>Drosophila melanogaster</em> is an
    extremely attractive model system for reverse engineering the emergent properties
    of neural circuits because it implements complex sensory-driven behaviors with
    a nervous system comprising a number of components that is five orders of magnitude
    smaller than those of mammals. A powerful toolkit of well-developed genetic techniques
    and advanced electrophysiological recording tools enables the fly&rsquo;s behavior
    to be experimentally linked to the function of its neural circuitry. To enable
    neuroscientists to use these strengths of fly brain research to surmount the structural
    complexity of its brain and create an accurate model of the entire fly brain,
    we have developed an open Python framework called Neurokernel designed to enable
    collaborative development of comprehensive fly brain models and their execution
    and testing on multiple Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). Neurokernel&rsquo;s
    model support architecture is motivated by the organization of the fly brain into
    fewer than 50 functional modules called local processing units (LPUs) that are
    each characterized by a unique population of local neurons. By defining communication
    interfaces that specify how spikes and neuron membrane states are transmitted
    between LPUs, Neurokernel enables researchers to collaboratively develop and refine
    whole-brain emulations by integration of independently developed processing units.
    Neurokernel will also empower researchers to leverage additional GPU resources
    and future improvements in GPU technology to accelerate model execution to the
    same time scale as a live fly brain; this will enable in vivo validation of Neurokernel-based
    models against real-time recordings of live fly brain activity. We demonstrate
    Neurokernel&rsquo;s module interfacing feature by using it to integrate independently
    developed models of olfactory and vision LPUs based upon experimentally obtained
    connectivity information.</p>

  title: An In-Depth Analysis of Open Data Portals as an Emerging Public E-Service
  description: |-
    <p>Governments collect and produce large amounts of<br>
    data. Increasingly, governments worldwide have started to implement<br>
    open data initiatives and also launch open data portals to enable the<br>
    release of these data in open and reusable formats. Therefore, a large<br>
    number of open data repositories, catalogues and portals have been<br>
    emerging in the world. The greater availability of interoperable and<br>
    linkable open government data catalyzes secondary use of such data,<br>
    so they can be used for building useful applications which leverage<br>
    their value, allow insight, provide access to government services, and<br>
    support transparency. The efficient development of successful open<br>
    data portals makes it necessary to evaluate them systematic, in order<br>
    to understand them better and assess the various types of value they<br>
    generate, and identify the required improvements for increasing this<br>
    value. Thus, the attention of this paper is directed particularly to the<br>
    field of open data portals. The main aim of this paper is to compare<br>
    the selected open data portals on the national level using content<br>
    analysis and propose a new evaluation framework, which further<br>
    improves the quality of these portals. It also establishes a set of<br>
    considerations for involving businesses and citizens to create eservices<br>
    and applications that leverage on the datasets available from<br>
    these portals.</p>

  title: AGINFRA PLUS D3.1 - Open Science Data Analytics Technologies
  description: |-
    <p>Deliverable D3.1 &ldquo;Open Science Data Analytics Technologies&rdquo; is a deliverable of type Demonstrator meaning that it manifests in artefacts (software releases) other than reports. In particular, the deliverable is about the software realising the Data Analytics &amp; Processing Layer of the AGINFRA+. This software is part of a large software system named gCube (www.gcube-system.org). The gCube system offers a large array of services supporting the entire lifecycle underlying a research activity (data management and collation, analytics, collaboration, sharing) and the possibility to combine these services in Virtual Research Environments. In the context of AGINFRA PLUS the following gCube components have been primarily exploited, consolidated and enhanced to serve the analytics needs arising in the context of the project use cases. DataMiner, i.e. a service enacting its users to perform data analytics tasks by relying on an array of analytics methods and a distributed and heterogeneous computing infrastructure. This service is available by a web-based GUI as well as via a web-based API based on the OGC WPS standard. SAI (Statistical Algorithm Importer), i.e. a service enacting its users to make available their own analytics methods via the DataMiner service. In addition to that, the entire analytics solution made available for AGINFRA PLUS cases counts on (i) a shared workspace realising a cloud-based file manager for managing content of interest and sharing this content with co-workers, (ii) a social networking area enabling users to post messages and have discussions, (iii) a flexible catalogue enabling to publish and discover items of interest including &ldquo;research objects&rdquo; resulting from an analytics task. This technology is deployed in its latest version in every Virtual Research Environment supporting AGINFRA PLUS cases. The major enhancements to the technology pertaining to AGINFRA PLUS have been included in three gCube major releases&nbsp;4.7 (October 2017), 4.8 (November 2017), and 4.9 (under production).In particular, with these releases a new &ldquo;black-box&rdquo; oriented approach (https://wiki.gcubesystem.org/gcube/Statistical_Algorithms_Importer:_Java_Project#Black_Box_Integration) has been envisaged and implemented to enact analytics method owners and developers to easily integrate their solutions into the DataMinerservice. Among the supported black-box typologies there is that for KNIME workflows, i.e. analytics methods implemented by a KNIME workflow. KNIME is among the key technologies supporting the Food Safety Risk Assessment cases. In order to enact the execution of KNIME-based black-boxes, the distributed computing part of the data analytics platform has been extended to integrate the KNIME execution engine. Other cases are counting on the same mechanism to integrate entire applications (WOFOST) as well as Python-based methods.</p>

    <p>The deliverable has been created on the public space of the AGINFRA+ Wiki and is accessible through the following link:</p>

  title: 'Extending Mobile Cloud Platforms Using Opportunistic Networks: Survey, Classification
    and Open Issues'
  description: With the tremendous growth of mobile devices, e.g, smartphones, tablets
    and PDAs in recent years, people are looking for more advanced platforms in order
    to use their computational applications (e.g., processing and storage) in a faster
    and more convenient way. In addition, mobile devices are capable of using cloud-based
    applications and the use of such technology is growing in popularity. However,
    one major concern is how to efficiently access these cloud-based applications
    when using a resource-constraint mobile device. Because it requires a continuous
    Internet connection which is difficult to obtain in challenged environments that
    lack an infrastructure for communication (e.g., in sparse or rural areas) or areas
    with infrastructure (e.g., urban or high density areas) with restricted/full of
    interference access networks and even areas with high costs of Internet roaming.
    In these situations the use of opportunistic networks may be extended to avail
    cloud-based applications to the user. In this paper we explore the emergence of
    extending mobile cloud platforms using opportunistic networks. The motivation
    of this paper is twofold. First, we classify the available mobile cloud architectures
    according to their intent, the way they deliver services, and survey the state
    of the art research and issues related to their performance (e.g., battery power,
    storage capacity, bandwidth utilisation), environments (e.g., heterogeneity of
    networks, user's collaborations), robustness (e.g., scalability and availability
    of resources) and efficiency (e.g., context aware mobile services, access costs,
    energy consumption). Second, we devise a new `mobile-opportunistic collaborative
    cloud' (MoCC) architecture which enhances mobile cloud platforms using opportunistic
    networks. Next, we outline the open issues and future research directions that
    need to be improved upon for delivering a more scalable, location-aware and context
    based service to the users.

  title: Towards Linked Open Molecular Data: Recommendations for researchers, collections,
    infrastructures and publishers
  description: "<p>The variety of molecular methods used to analyze biosamples is
    continuously increasing, as is the need for the standardized deposition, documentation
    and citation of both the samples as well as the methods applied to them. Global
    initiatives such as the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration
    (INSDC, http://www.insdc.org), Barcode of Life Data System (BOLD, http://www.boldsystems.org),
    the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF, http://www.gbif.org) and the
    Global Genome Biodiversity Network (GGBN, http://www.ggbn.org), in addition to
    many others, have been working towards standardized access to biological data
    for many years. Collectively, these biodiversity data management platforms provide
    a considerable and indispensable infrastructure to the research community. However,
    cross-linking the massive amounts of protein and DNA sequence data submitted to
    these databases every year with standardized records of the underlying biological
    material remains challenging. Best practices for standardized data submissions
    and data citations are urgently needed.</p>\n  <p>In the long run, two goals should
    be achieved above all else:</p>\n  \n    all sequence data should be linked to
    natural history collections, and\n    biological material that was used for molecular
    research, especially DNA sequencing, should be deposited and, thus, made accessible
    in public, well curated collections.\n  \n  <p>Here we will provide recommendations
    both for researchers and collections how to cite underlying biological material
    at INSDC and in publications in a standardized way towards Linked Open Data. We
    will also address how the global infrastructures and publishers can improve their
    interoperability.</p>"

  title: What is the effect of an open access makerspace on the development of its
    community? Literature Review
  description: |-
    <p>Open-access makerspaces are popping up everywhere. They claim to provide their communities an essential portal to a world of opportunities. How do we know if they achieve this? This review summarises the available literature on the effect of open-access makerspaces on the communities in which they exist, and discusses potential measures of those effects.</p>

    <p>The open-access makerspace is something of a new concept that doesn&rsquo;t fit neatly into traditional economic models. A makerspace offers benefits not easily tested by conventional outcomes-based measures. These problems pose a challenge for those seeking support for a makerspace, and for funders who may have difficulty understanding the role of today&rsquo;s makerspace or are reticent about investing in a relatively untested concept.</p>

    <p>There is scant quantitative information available describing the effect of an open-access makerspace. This literature review focuses on largely qualitative information. It casts a wide net across seminal books on the Maker Movement, surveys, criticism, and social innovation writing to pull answers together.</p>

    <p>A well supported open-access makerspace can provide advantages to all members of a community by providing access to a recent convergence of technologies in a collaborative setting. The effect of a makerspace on the development of its community can and should be measured.</p>

    <p>It is hoped that this review will be a tool for those starting or supporting an open-access makerspace.</p>

  title: 'Linked Open Data for Taxonomic Databases: The Nordic/Baltic implementation'
  description: <p>Starting with Finland and Sweden and a subset of taxonomic groups,
    the Nordic/Baltic countries are connecting national checklists using Linked Open
    Data standards (Auer et al. 2007) and agreed vocabularies. We use HTTP Uniform
    Resource Identifiers as globally unique, persistent identifiers for taxon concepts
    (Chawuthai et al. 2013). Currently, we provide both human-readable (html) and
    machine-readable (xml) responses for client requests via a central checklist,
    TAXONID.ORG, which in itself needs to be managed. However, we hope this can be
    replaced by Catalogue of Life Plus in a not too distant future. While initially
    exchanging taxonomic information, our goal is ultimately to share information
    also on genetics, images and traits as well as conservation status and observations
    in a standardized way. The work is part of the NeIC DeepDive project which is
    funded by the Nordic e-Infrastructure Collaboration (neic.no/deepdive). The vision
    is to establish a regional infrastructure network consisting of Nordic and Baltic
    data centers and information systems and to provide seamlessly operating regional
    data services, tools, and virtual laboratories.</p>

  title: 'Modelling Mailing List Behaviour in Open Source Projects: the Case of ARM
    Embedded Linux'
  description: One of the benefits firms can derive from using Open Source Software
    (OSS) is informal development collaboration, and the primary tool for collaboration
    and coordination are group mailing lists. The purpose of the paper is modelling
    mailing lists behaviour in OSS projects, using a set of descriptors that could
    inform about their quality and their evolution. As a case study, a mailing list
    focused on ARM embedded Linux has been selected. Messages posted to this list
    from 2001 to 2006 have been extracted, and factor analysis has been applied to
    obtain the underlying patterns of behaviours. Theory about communities of practice
    has been used to understand the meaning of the extracted patterns. Their time
    distribution is finally described. The paper provides new insights into the behaviour
    of mailing list as a source of support for OSS projects and highlights the importance
    of an involved core of individuals inside the community.

    robust acquisition of thousands of three-dimensional multicolor microscopy images,
    the handling of microfluidics devices, and the remote monitoring of ongoing acquisitions

  title: 'Where the researcher cannot get: open platforms to collaborate with citizens
    on cultural heritage research data'
  description: <p>Over the years, many research projects and research groups have
    accumulated large collections of raw data, nowadays they are normally compiled
    and stored in local archives, more often on personal computers and sometimes on
    Intranet servers. Local data represents a missed opportunity for research projects,
    in particular in the cultural heritage field. The vast majority of these datasets,
    even those that are already available in a digital format, remain hidden, underused
    and incomplete because they are linked to the effort and limited resources of
    a single researcher or a specific research group. This paper proposes a shift
    from Local Data to Open Platforms, from data stored locally and accessible only
    to a restricted number of researchers to remotely accessible, editable and sharable
    datasets. Online platforms perfectly fit the needs of&nbsp;a research group that
    is experiencing the limits of first-hand data collection and verification or that
    intends to extend the potential area of source collection. To demonstrate the
    effectiveness of this proposal, three different case studies will be explored.
    They have all been recently developed as the result of collaborations between
    the author and university research groups in the humanities. Despite sharing a
    common background in cultural heritage, they are very different with respect to
    the object of study. The core of this paper is the discussion, where we analyse
    the lessons learnt from applying this approach, highlighting its benefits and
    the intrinsic issues of the process.</p>

  title: How to Integrate Open Data with Local Knowledge in Co-designed ICT Solutions?
  description: '<p>Information and Communication Technology (ICT) applications developed
    without end-users participation may encounter problems in the development and
    the uptake phase. Bottom-up co-design with end-users and participatory techniques
    can constitute an approach to direct tools and data infrastructure development
    overcoming those risks. In this paper, we present two ICT pilots that have been
    developed in the context of the CAPSELLA research project with farmers&rsquo;
    communities from Greece, Italy and Netherlands, starting from their own requirements.
    Soil health management has been detected as a crucial activity to raise awareness
    on and to develop ICT tools for. This issue has been addressed at temporal and
    spatial level: (i) at temporal level, with a pilot that aims to support soil health
    self-assessment and evaluation of soil organic matter dynamics as result of farmers
    practices using open data on soil and weather conditions; and (ii) at spatial
    level, with a pilot that aims to support farmers in precision farming management
    of organic fertilisation using parcel linked electromagnetic soil scan data. In
    our case study, farmers showed interest in ICT solutions supporting their activities
    as well as the need to integrate local knowledge with external information (e.g.
    coming from open data). Cooperation with farmers as an effort to be concrete with
    open data use in agriculture brought to tangible results in our case.</p>'

  description: <p>The goal of the SensApp FET-Open project is to develop an innovative
    super-sensor that will be able to detect Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease (AD) biomarkers
    (&beta;-amyloid, Tau and pTAU) in peripheral blood. Considering that nowadays
    an accurate diagnosis of AD requires the highly invasive withdrawal and analysis
    of cerebrospinal fluid, SensApp will represent a breakthrough in the field of
    AD diagnosis thanks to the ability to detect the early stage of the disease by
    a simple blood collection. We call Droplet-Split-and-Stack (DSS) the new technology
    that will emerge from SensApp. The achievement of SensApp goal is enabled by the
    interdisciplinary cooperation between different research institutions and one
    company involved in the key fields of the project, Vrije Universiteit Brussels,
    VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland, University of Linz, Ginolis Ltd, IRCCS

  title: Taiwan Biodiversity Information Facility (TaiBIF)'s Role in Facilitating
    Open Biodiversity Data in Taiwan
  description: <p>Taiwan Biodiversity Information Facility (TaiBIF) was established
    in 2001 as one of the first Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) nodes.
    Funded by Taiwan's Ministry of Science and Technology and Forestry Bureau, TaiBIF's
    missions are to:</p><p>Develop infrastructures for biodiversity-related data,</p><p>Promote
    the open data concept,</p><p>Facilitate the publication and integration of biodiversity
    information,</p><p>Support biodiversity-related research and policy-making, and</p><p>Connect
    Taiwan and international biodiversity information.</p><p>As part of the work to
    fulfill its missions, TaiBIF develops and maintains infrastructures such as a
    data portal, Taiwan Catalogue of Life (TaiCoL), and a tool for scientific name-checking
    - NomenMatch, for public and researchers to use as needed. Additionally, as the
    only GBIF data hosting centre currently available in Asia, TaiBIF offers all services
    mentioned in the GBIF's data hosting criteria. Briefly, this includes a regularly
    maintained Integrated Publishing Toolkit (IPT) and help desk for supporting users
    in dataset and data paper publishing process. In the continuous effort to promote
    open biodiversity data, TaiBIF organises workshops annually for students, researchers,
    and any governmental or non-governmental organisations, providing hands-on training
    focusing on data standardising and the publishing process. As of June 2022, Taiwan
    has exposed more than 13 million occurrence records and 83 datasets through GBIF's
    data platform, contributed mostly by 19 data publishing units, making it the second-largest
    data contributor in Asia (after India). These data have been used in many peer-reviewed
    studies on various topics and for guiding conservation policies. TaiBIF has maintained
    close interactions and cooperation with GBIF, regularly assisting in the Biodiversity
    Information Fund for Asia (BIFA) projects, regional workshops and communications
    between members from Asian countries. TaiBIF's current active tasks include allying
    with the Taiwan Biodiversity Information Alliance (TBIA), a national biodiversity
    network aimed at the integration of local biodiversity data from various governmental
    agencies and museums. Furthermore, a volunteer training system is being developed
    to support workloads at the TaiBIF office. Recognising the importance of data
    coverage, a data review study of open biodiversity data status in Taiwan is ongoing.</p>

  title: 'Scientific reuse of open biodiversity information from national Living Atlases
    infrastructures: Using ALA4R for reproducible research studies'
  description: |-
    <p>During the last few years, a large number of countries have deployed national customized versions of The Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) (https://www.ala.org.au/), which is a collaboratively developed, open infrastructure for collecting and presenting biodiversity data nationally and for sharing it globally through GBIF (https://gbif.org).</p>
      <p>The increasing number of national nodes deploying this free and open source software platform has built a worldwide community involving more than 17 countries, that collaborate openly in a decentralized way (https://living-atlases.gbif.org/), helping each other out by organizing technical workshops and by developing and sharing new software modules using GitHub.</p>
      <p>One of these modules in the Living Atlases infrastructure is an R package called ALA4R originally created by Ben Raymond (https://github.com/AtlasOfLivingAustralia/ALA4R). It provides the research community with programmatic data access to many of the Living Atlases data services using R.</p>
      <p>This presentation will show how ALA4R can be used to access data from different national Living Atlases nodes and how this R package can enable research studies that utilize methods and practices for reproducible workflows that are being increasingly established within the research community (https://www.britishecologicalsociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/guide-to-reproducible-code.pdf).</p>

  title: Wind Tunnel Testing of a Open-Loop Wake Deflection Under Dynamic Wind Direction
    Changes
  description: |-
    <p>In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the development of cooperative control strategies for turbines within a wind plant, with the goals of increasing power capture, mitigating loads and providing ancillary services. Among the approaches investigated so far, wake steering by yawing the upwind turbines seems to be the most promising one. Indeed, several studies demonstrated the effectiveness of this approach for steady wind directions by means of high-fidelity simulations<sup>[1]</sup> and wind tunnel testing<sup>[2]</sup>. Moreover, field tests<sup> </sup>also provided encouraging results<sup>[3]</sup>.</p>

    <p>The research presented in this paper aims at further understanding and characterizing the effectiveness of this strategy with respect to dynamic changes in wind direction. For this purpose, wind tunnel tests were conducted with three scaled wind turbines<sup>[2]</sup> within the framework of the H2020 CL-Windcon project. Dynamic wind direction changes were simulated by rotating the wind tunnel turntable (Fig. 1a), according to a pre-defined time series derived from field measurements. Two different inflow conditions were considered to resemble typical onshore and offshore environments. The control laws were implemented by means of look-up tables (LUT) that, for below-rated wind conditions, schedule the yaw misalignment of each turbine in the plant according to measureed ambient wind direction and turbulence intensity. The LUTs were synthesized according to the robust formulation of Rott et al.<sup>[4]</sup>, using the FLORIS wake model. The conducted tests also characterized the sensitivity of the farm-level power capture to different ways of filtering wind direction measurements, as well as to the uncertainties used for the derivation of the LUTs.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;Preliminary results show that these relatively simple control laws achieve a power increase of up to 10-15% in offshore inflow conditions for wind directions between &plusmn;7&nbsp;deg (with the three aligned wind turbines corresponding to the 0&nbsp;deg wind direction). Considering the probability distribution of the wind direction, the cumulative power gain is up to approx.&nbsp;8%.&nbsp;</p>

  title: 'Framing Open Design through Theoretical Concepts and Practical Applications:
    A Systematic Literature Review'
  description: '<p>This study reports on the results of a systematic literature review
    on&lsquo;open design&rsquo;&nbsp;in academic fields including and beyond design
    and HCI. The review investigates how studies are framed as open design and open-source
    design (including&nbsp;&lsquo;open hardware&rsquo;): how researchers contribute
    to conceptual theorizing about open design or study its practical operationalization,
    in do-it-yourself&nbsp;&lsquo;making,&rsquo;&nbsp;manufacturing and practices
    in-between these domains. Most of the papers reviewed were empirical studies from
    diverse fields. Open design was analyzed not only as contributions and solutions,
    but also as open-to-participate processes, openly shared processes, and open,
    closed, and modular (open and closed) outcomes. Various research fields presented
    an open design framing as an alternative to the status quo: new ways to do business
    and/or to foster socio-environmental sustainability. On the manufacturing side,
    open design was sought especially to accelerate innovation cycles; on the making
    side, it was espoused to foster democratization. However, the studies reviewed
    indicated that companies do not appear to develop much beyond business-as-usual.
    From the research perspective, the conceptual potential of open design to promote
    sustainability saw little practical exploration. Additionally, issues around open
    design community governance and ownership, safety and reliability of open outcomes
    require further investigation.</p>'

  title: The Semantic Alignment of H-FOAF, DOMAIN and DBLP Ontologies with Link Open
    Data for a Health Social Network
  description: <p>The aim of this study is to make collaborative networks of practitioners
    and researchers especially for healthcare community by using semantic web standards
    such as FOAF, etc. The proposed collaborative ontology modeling helps to resolve
    semantic alignment between distributed developed vocabularies/ontologies with
    domain ontology (cardiac-process) by using collaborative methodology. This collaborative
    ontology mechanism helps to find specific personnel who are involved in certain
    tasks, activities with assigned roles and involved in some research projects and
    attached with health-oriented social community. This approach also helps to publish
    domain factual knowledge with some link open data (LOD) resources, e.g. DBpedia

  title: Assessment of Open-Ended Questions using a Multidimensional Approach for
    the Interaction and Collaboration of Learners in E-Learning Environments
  description: 'Currently, the assessment of learners in conventional e-learning systems
    is only one dimension in which learners are required to produce answers, for example,
    by selecting multiple-choice, true/false, or matching answers or by giving short
    answers. This type of assessment still lacks interactions among the learners,
    and thus, it might not fully support learning. Many researchers have endeavored
    to propose an open-ended question method for evaluation, but their methods still
    focus on content assessment rather than learners'' activities, which again lacks
    interactions among the learners. This paper concentrates on creating a new assessment
    method using open-ended questions with the aim of enhancing collaborations, activities
    and interactions of learners at the same time. The objectives are as follows:
    1) to develop a process model for multidimensional assessment (M-DA) to enable
    effective learning; 2) to develop free-text answer assessments using a vector
    space model and a semantic extraction model; and 3) to develop an algorithm for
    evaluating learners based on a M-DA to encourage learners'' activities. In addition,
    we created an environment for learners to be actively assessed and to interact
    with others when studying online. Two groups of parallel learners taking an e-course
    were tested on the two systems in a virtual learning environment. The results
    of the experiment noted that the system with multidimensional assessment showed
    a better outcome than the system without M-DA.'

  title: Sharing Your Work in Open Access
  description: <p>The scholarly research when read and commented by peers would enable
    creation of new knowledge. This knowledge when collaboratively sourced, reviewed
    and applied would develop new technologies for the public good. In this process,
    the scholars or researchers would get recognition, appreciation and citation by
    peers and promotions at work place. However, in the life cycle of knowledge creation
    and development of public good technologies, there is a considerable time lag
    and has issues about accessibility. Though the scholarly research is available,
    it is not accessible to everyone. Nevertheless, with the advent of new web 2.0
    technologies, and licensing terms, all the researchers can now be able to sharing
    their scholarly research among peers globally in real-time and pave way for building
    upon their work for knowledge creation and technology development. Traditionally,
    the research work is first read at the scholarly conferences and is made available
    as conference proceedings and then the outcomes are published in the peer-reviewed
    journals. In this process, the work is evaluated by the peer review process for
    its credibility and upon publication as an article in a journal; the work gets
    sanctity and endorsement. This module shall discuss about the ways and means of
    sharing the scholarly research globally via the World Wide Web and answer a few
    questions viz., Where to publish? How to choose a suitable journal? What is the
    journal publication process? In addition, how to share the published work?</p>

  title: Publication Options Suitable for Aircraft Design - Open Access Journals Edited
    by Members of European Aerospace Organizations
  description: '<p>Open Access publishing in the field of &quot;aircraft design&quot;&nbsp;is
    characterized today by: 1.) The fact that a dedicated journal about aircraft design
    is currently missing. 2.) A problematic situation to find a suitable aerospace
    Open Access journal (as shown in a previous publication). It has been observed
    that authors need a certain amount of trust in the journal and its operator. This
    level of trust will be higher, if authors select a journal run by people and organizations
    they know quite well. For this reason, Open Access journals in aerospace are presented
    edited by members of European aerospace organizations. Only 4 such Open Access
    journals seem to exist presently. The Romanian &quot;INCAS Bulletin&quot;&nbsp;was
    started in 2009 and has published several hundred papers. The journal seems well
    established. The Polish &quot;Transactions of the Institute of Aviation&quot;&nbsp;were
    started already 1951 and are already online since 2006, but lack a clear publishing
    structure and are dominated by articles in Polish. &quot;Transport and Aerospace
    Engineering&quot;&nbsp;from Latvia is well set up, was started only recently (in
    2014) and has only 10 articles so far. The journal &quot;Advances in Aerospace
    Science and Technology&quot;&nbsp;has its roots in the USA (registration), China
    (operation), and Germany (editor). The journal stresses a setup based on international
    standards and has ambitions to include a regular Special Issue on Aircraft Design.
    With a start early in 2015, the prove of all this is still missing. None of these
    4 journals has a Thomson Reuters Impact Factor or any &quot;prestige&quot;. For
    authors who demand this, only traditional subscription based closed access journals
    exist. Green Open Access with self publication of journal articles in repositories
    is a way to make papers openly available also from these closed access journals.</p>'

  title: 'Opening Scholarly Communication in Social Sciences: Supporting Open Peer
    Review with Fidus Writer'
  description: |-
    <p>Scholarly communication in the social sciences is centered around publications, in which data also play a key role. The increasingly collaborative scientific process, from a project plan, to collecting data, to interpreting them in a paper and submitting it for peer review, to publishing an article, to, finally, its consumption by readers, is insufficiently supported by contemporary information systems.<br />
    They support every individual step, but media discontinuities between steps cause inefficiency and loss of information: word processors lack direct access to data; reviewers cannot provide feedback inside the environment in which authors revising their papers; open access web publishing is constrained to document formats designed for paper printing but neglecting the Web&rsquo;s accessibility<br />
    and interactivity potential; finally, readers, seeing a single frozen view of the underlying data in a paper, are unable to access the full extent of the data and to make observations beyond the restricted scope chosen by the author.<br />
    Web technology can address these problems. Isolated solutions, such as tools for publishing data on the Web for easy retrieval and visualization, exist in preliminary manifestations in the social sciences, but have not been integrated into tools for writing, reviewing and publishing articles. Tools that assist writers in making their documents&rsquo; structure explicit for information systems, as well as document<br />
    browsers that use articles as interactive interfaces to related information on the Web have been successfully deployed in the life sciences. In the Opening Scholarly Communication in Social Sciences (OSCOSS) project, founded by DFG, we will transfer these ideas to the social sciences by integrating existing data and publication management services into a web-based collaborative writing environment that publishers can set up to supports all types of end users throughout the publication process: authors, reviewers and readers.<br />
    With the collaborative document editor Fidus Writer and Open Journal Systems system we choose a stable technical foundation. We secure user acceptance by respecting the characteristics of the traditional processes social scientists are used to: web publications must have the same high-quality layout as print publications, and information must remain citable by stable page numbers. To ensure we meet these requirements, we will work closely with the publishers of<br />
    &ldquo;methods, data, analyses&rdquo; (mda) and &ldquo;Historical Social Research&rdquo; (HSR), two international peer reviewed open accessible journals published by GESIS, and build early demonstrators for usability evaluation.<br />
    Our system will initially provide readers, authors and reviewers with an alternative, thus having the potential to gain wider acceptance and gradually replace the old, incoherent publication process of our journals and of others in related fields. It will make journals more &ldquo;open&rdquo; (in terms of reusability) that are open access already, and it has the potential to serve as an incentive for turning &ldquo;closed&rdquo; journals into open access ones.<br />
    In this poster we will present the framework of the system and highlight the following use case.<br />
    Reviewer Scenario: Jakob and Dagmar submitted their manuscript, pointing to data and the R code, to the journal mda. Rainer gets assigned Jakob and Dagmars&rsquo;s manuscript for review. He wants to check whether Jakob and Dagmar have done their analysis in a correct way. He downloads their R code and raw data and redoes the calculation described in the paper. He observes that, for one of the statements that Jakob and Dagmar have made in the results section of their manuscript, the R output of the analysis does not give sufficient evidence. They should have known from Ariane&rsquo;s paper published two years ago, that in one of the items of the dataset that they analysed, some data items are too sparse for reliably applying the significance test to them. Rainer marks the respective statement in Jakob&rsquo;s and Dagmar&rsquo;s result section, adding a reference to the methodology section of Ariane&rsquo;s paper and to the affected item in the dataset. Finally, the editorial board decides to accept the submission, given that a major revision is made. Jakob and Dagmar receive the paper with 100 comments attached. As the comments are attached to precise parts of the paper, grouped by<br />
    reviewers and classified as &ldquo;major&rdquo; vs. &ldquo;minor&rdquo;, they can quickly prioritise the necessary tasks to improve their article.</p>

  title: Taxonomic Treatments as Open FAIR Digital Objects
  description: <p>Taxonomy is the science of charting and describing the worlds biodiversity.
    Organisms are grouped into taxa which are given a given rank building the taxonomic
    hierarchy. The taxa are described in taxonomic treatments, well defined sections
    of scientific publications (Catapano 2019). They include a nomenclatural section
    and one or more sections including descriptions, material citations referring
    to studied specimens, or notes ecology and behavior. In case the treatment does
    not describe a new discovered taxon, previous treatments are cited in the form
    of treatment citations. This citation can refer to a previous treatment and add
    additional data, or it can be a statement synonymizing the taxon with another
    taxon. This allows building a citation network, and ultimately is a constituent
    part of the catalogue of life. Thus treatments play an important role to understand
    the diversity of life on Earth by providing the scientific argument why group
    of organism is a new species, or a synonym, and the data provided will increasingly
    be important to analyze and compare whole genomes of individual genomes.</p><p>Treatments
    have been extracted by Plazi since 2008 (Agosti and Egloff 2009), and the TaxPub
    schema has been described by Catapano (Catapano 2019) to complement existing vocabularies
    to allow annotation of legacy literature and to produce new publications including
    the respective annotations (Penev et al. 2010). Today, more than 750,000 treatments
    have been annotated by Plazi's TreatmenBank and over 400,000 have been made FAIR
    digital objects in the Biodiversity Literature Repository in a collaboration of
    Plazi, Zenodo and Pensoft (Ioannidis-Pantopikos and Agosti 2021, Agosti et al.
    2019), and are reused by the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF),
    Global Biotic Interaction (GloBI), and the Library System of the Swiss Institute
    of Bioinformatics (SIBiLS).</p><p>Each treatment on the Zenodo repository is findable
    through its rich metadata. The insertion of custom metadata in Zenodo provides
    metadata referring to domain specific vocabularies such as Darwin Core (Ioannidis-Pantopikos
    and Agosti 2021). The treatment are accessible through its DataCite Digital Object
    Identifier (DOI) for the taxonomic treatment as subtype of a publication. The
    data is interoperable by machine actionable JSON version of the treatment. A license
    is provided to assure it is reusable.</p><p>The richness of data and citations
    within a treatment provide a stepping stone to add treatments not only to knowledge
    systems such as Wikidata or openBioDiv, but to provide links to many of the cited
    objects, such as specimens through the material citations, and thus a well curated
    assemblage of links. Being a FAIR digital object, treatments can be cited and
    should ultimately linked to from a taxonomic name used in an identification of
    an organism.</p>

  title: Exploring Interrelationships among High School Students' Engagement Factors
    in Introductory Programming Courses via a 3D Multi-user Serious Game Created in
    Open Sim
  description: The technological affordances of three-dimensional (3D) multi-user
    virtual worlds and their effectiveness in task-based learning approaches are to
    a large extent well-established in the international field of computer literacy
    research. However, less attention was given to their positive or negative impact
    on student engagement. The current study seeks to investigate the interrelationships
    of students' engagement among multidimensional constructs consisting of cognitive,
    emotional and behavioral factors in order to understand better the educational
    community the learning effectiveness emerged through a 3D computer-supported and
    multi-user serious game created for introductory programming courses. An instructional
    design framework based on Papert's theory of Constructionism to be amplified the
    students' activities and management of their interactions in a 3D multi-user serious
    game created via an Open Sim standalone server integrated with Scratch4OS is also
    proposed. Fifty-five (n=55) voluntary students from three different high schools
    participated and experienced in a 3D mind-trap puzzle game named Co.Co.I.A. (Collaborative
    Construction of Interactive Artifacts) to learn basic programming structures.
    The empirical study findings indicated that student behavioral engagement (attention,
    retention and energy expenditure for activity completion) had not only a linear
    correlation with cognitive engagement (learning strategies for the construction
    of the knowledge domain), but it had also a positive association with emotional
    engagement (students' positive emotions and achievement orientation) in collaborative
    learning tasks, causing the reinforcement of the other two factors as well.

  description: <p>In this paper, we focus on the problem of understanding the risks
    and benefits of open data publishing, drawing in part on risk management strategies
    in other fields. We note that while some work has been done on open data risk
    assessment for government publishers, there is little guidance for civil society
    organizations (CSOs) who wish to publish open data. To address this, we develop
    a framework and toolkit that can assist CSOs in conducting risk assessments before
    sharing or publishing their data, especially in the context of cross-border data
    sharing. We then conducted a series of interviews with 27 experts to assess our
    toolkit. They all had a background in open data implementation among CSOs and
    governments in the lower-Mekong region, where international open data sharing
    is ongoing. Based on this, we recommend several ways in which the toolkit can
    be applied, as well as opportunities for further research</p>

  title: Democratizing microscopy by introducing innovative Open-Source hard and software
    tools
  description: <p>Science lives from the curiosity to get to the bottom of problems
    and from the subsequent discussion, where scientists exchange knowledge and opinions
    to finally come up with new questions. However, as a recent study showed, the
    vast majority of the experiments conducted within publications can often only
    be replicated partially, if at all, which contributes to the rising disbelief
    from society into scientific practice [1]. The high level of exclusivity of scientific
    experiments is often due to a lack of available instruments and knowledge of their
    use, as well as their high cost makes it impossible for many researchers to replicate
    their experiments. Particularly in high-resolution microscopy, which is an essential
    tool for many different scientific disciplines such as cell biology or biochemistry
    this is a problem to be solved if we aim for realistic interdisciplinary scientific
    exchange. With the ever-growing open-source optical toolbox UC2 (&quot;You.See.Too.&quot;)
    [2] we show that this is not only important but also possible. With UC2, we are
    trying to democratize optics and microscopy in particular. To achieve this, UC2
    relies on widely available components and 3D-printed parts so that it can be easily
    built by anyone, anywhere. Through online platforms such as GitHub [3], we enable
    anyone to use, replicate, and customize it for individual purposes open-source
    licenses. Additionally, we invite users from around the world to share their designs
    with the community in order to create an iterative and decentralized optimization
    loop. This way, completely new collaborations can be created, from the field of
    education to the realm of cutting-edge biology. In the ongoing Corona pandemic,
    we were able to show that state-of-the-art microscopic imaging can be realized
    even where access to such equipment is very limited, but no less urgently necessary.
    Also, we were able to detect and even optically resolve the SARS-CoV2 coronavirus
    in the high-safety biological laboratory. The open-source nature of UC2 allows
    connecting with other open projects to unite the expertise of scientists from
    around the world, together with approaching the goal of making cutting-edge tools
    available to all. Additionally scaling up the production of the UC2-components
    and organizing interdisciplinary workshops, we hope to lower the entry barriers
    to get creative with optics and think science easily out of the box.</p>

  title: What is it like to be a Giant anteater? Cytoarchitectonic analysis of open
    data with MicroDraw.
  description: |-
    <p>Brain histology provides unique information on the cellular structure of the brain. Histological data has been collected for more than a century, and is available for a wide variety of species and developmental stages. This type of data is, however, challenging to visualise, analyse and share. Here we present the current state of our Web tool MicroDraw, which aims at addressing these challenges through virtual distributed collaboration. We describe a complete analysis of the cytoarchitecture of a giant anteater brain, from data preprocessing to the representation of a quantitative cytoarchitectonic parcellation. Our results show that MicroDraw can be used to analyse high-resolution histological data, enabling distributed collaboration to improve our understanding of the cellular structure of the brain.</p>

  title: 'Speedy Palaeoanthropology: How virtual morphology, digital databases and
    open access policies boost research in human evolution'
  description: |-
    <p>The last two decades have seen the development of virtual morphology (ViMo), which emerged during the late 20<sup>th</sup> century through the application of medical imaging techniques to the study of fossil hominins (Spoor et al. 1994, Zollikofer et al. 1995, Conroy et al. 1998). The ViMo workflow has evolved successively by first building digital databases of fossil hominins, followed by digital reference collections, through the development of virtual 3D geometric morphometrics and, more recently, also 3D-printing (Fig. 1; Bastir et al. 2019). ViMo-workflows have led to a renaissance of morphological studies of diversity in evolutionary Earth and life sciences.</p>
      <p>The aim of this presentation is to briefly present standard workflows in the Virtual Morphology Lab in the <em>Museo Nacional de Ciencias Naturales</em>, Madrid, and to show, more generally, how ViMo-technologies, together with paradigmatic changes in science (open access, digital data bases), contribute to boosting current research in human paleontology.</p>
      <p>The accidental discovery, in 2013, of fossil remains of a new human species, <em>Homo naledi,</em> in the Rising Star cave system, South Africa, has produced a large and important collection documenting early hominin diversity (Berger et al. 2015) . In the light of the huge amount of fossil material, a new research strategy was decided: different kinds of social media and an open-access policy were used for the organisation of a workshop focussed on the study of this new fossil collection and based on data sharing and global collaborations.</p>
      <p>Because of this modern strategy, <em>H. naledi</em> was published very soon after its discovery (Berger et al. 2015) and simultaneously, the digitized fossils were made available to the public via MorphoSource, an open-access database. As a consequence, only five years later, more than 30 scientific publications have yielded almost 600 citations. This productivity is much higher than in any other recently discovered hominin species.  Thus, 13 years after "glasnost" was proclaimed for paleoanthropology (Weber 2001), <em>H. naledi</em> has provided the first real example illustrating how open-access to digital collections accelerates and modifies research and diffusion in human paleontology.</p>

  title: Academic Libraries and Open Access Books in Europe. A Landscape Study
  description: |-
    <p>The last fifteen years have witnessed the emergence of a new role for academic libraries. Besides fulfilling<br>
    their fundamental task of providing access to knowledge, besides being called everything from<br>
    temples of knowledge to disturbing heterotopias, libraries have become one of the crucial stakeholders<br>
    in the open access book publishing space. They act as funders for OA book fees, they support<br>
    collaborative funding schemes, and sometimes they assume the role of publishers themselves.<br>
    In an attempt to create a sustainable publishing environment, in which OA books could blossom, it<br>
    is therefore necessary to gain a sound understanding of how academic libraries work, how they deal<br>
    with open access initiatives, and what challenges they encounter. These questions remain at the very<br>
    core of this report.<br>
    The landscape painted in this report is by no means exhaustive; there are many more countries in the<br>
    European community, other than the fourteen we have looked at, that need further investigating. The<br>
    sample that we have taken under closer inspection proved to be a lively and diverse organism that<br>
    escapes any easy overarching classifications. In order to better understand the role of academic and<br>
    research libraries in Europe regarding open access books, we have looked at several crucial aspects<br>
    that would help us both identify common threads and pinpoint regional particularities. We have examined<br>
    each country according to the following areas of interest: 1. general characteristics of library<br>
    systems for e-content and OA publications, 2. library community and open access, 3. OA book policies,<br>
    4. OA book funding, 5. library/scholar-led OA book publishing initiatives, and 6. integration of OA<br>
    books in library systems.</p>

  title: An Overview of the Open Science in Times of Big Data and Innovation to Global
    Health
  description: <p>The last several years have revealed information technology and
    scientific data to be important allies. However, the most important scientific
    ally is that which can assist in the complex task of identifying, collecting and
    treating the exponential amount of data added to the Web every day in the XXI
    century. Moreover, the volume of this data exceeds 2.5 x 10<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;new
    bytes per day and arrives on the Web at a rapid speed. Thus, it is necessary to
    assess the veracity of these data and their value to decision-making. Although
    approximately 43% of the data are related to health and about one million scientific
    articles published per year are in the health field, it is important to think
    beyond trivial models to solve problems of local health with a global focus. Thus,
    this work aims to contribute to the reflection on the use of free tools as well
    as to discussions of collaborative and effective partnerships for action in the&nbsp;<strong>field
    of Public Health</strong>. This study shows opportunities to use open science
    for global health innovation, mainly, to the countries with difficulty in managing
    the problems of their ills.&nbsp;<strong>Open science in times of Big Data</strong>&nbsp;are
    much more agile than the old model of closed science, i.e., isolated groups that
    either did not share data or did share but at prices that were unaffordable for
    developing or underdeveloped countries. Technological development for new chemical
    entities can be facilitated by using the open science of the&nbsp;<strong>Scientific&rsquo;s
    Big Data</strong>.</p>

  title: 'A DATA EXTRACTION ALGORITHM FROM OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE PROJECT REPOSITORIES
    FOR BUILDING DURATION ESTIMATION MODELS: CASE STUDY OF GITHUB'
  description: <p>Software project estimation is important for allocating resources
    and planning a reasonable work schedule. Estimation models are typically built
    using data from completed projects. While organizations have their historical
    data repositories, it is difficult to obtain their collaboration due to privacy
    and competitive concerns. To overcome the issue of public access to private data
    repositories this study proposes an algorithm to extract sufficient data from
    the GitHub repository for building duration estimation models. More specifically,
    this study extracts and analyses historical data on WordPress projects to estimate
    OSS project duration using commits as an independent variable as well as an improved
    classification of contributors based on the number of active days for each contributor
    within a release period. The results indicate that duration estimation models
    using data from OSS repositories perform well and partially solves the problem
    of lack of data encountered in empirical research in software engineering.</p>

  title: 'Quartz OA: the cooperative route to fair, sustainable and independent open
    access publishing. White paper.'
  description: |-
    <p>Open access (OA) to academic research outputs is crucial if we are to find solutions to global societal challenges, such as growing inequality, climate change and the current health crisis. Enabling equal access to knowledge can help bring social justice,<br>
    however, this depends on the &lsquo;route&rsquo; that is taken for transitioning to ubiquitous OA publishing.<br>
    In this white paper, we outline several important barriers the current academic publishing landscape presents to the transition to sustainable &ndash; but also just &ndash; open access publishing. We then propose a new route to open access: Quartz Open Access<br>
    Quartz OA is an ecosystem that facilitates exchanges of resources and funding among the open access community and a new channel to fund and support independent open access publishing. This paper presents our vision for a more just, sustainable and independent academic publishing; it outlines the values we build upon and the gevrnance model we propose. This white paper is also a call for the academic community to get involved in this initiative and start building a global Quartz OA community.<br>

  title: Data publication and dissemination of interactive keys under the open access
    model
  description: '<p>The concepts of publication, citation and dissemination of interactive
    keys and other online keys are discussed and illustrated by a sample paper published
    in the present issue (<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.3897/zookeys.21.271">doi:
    10.3897/zookeys.21.271</a>). The present model is based on previous experience
    with several existing examples of publishing online keys. However, this model
    also suggests ways to publish, cite, preserve, disseminate and reuse the original
    data files to the benefit of the authors, future workers, and society in general.
    To be regarded as a ''''formal scientific publication,'''' an online key should
    satisfy the same criteria of peer review, registration, persistence, bibliographic
    description, etc., as conventional publications. Keys can be published in a form
    of either ''''static''\''''dynamic'''' publications. We define a ''''static''''
    publication as a discrete unit of information preserved in a persistent and unchangeable
    way on the publisher''s Web site and/or on paper and consequently in conventional/electronic
    libraries and archives. This contrasts with the nature of the Internet, which
    allows and tends to encourage updating and improvement on a continuing basis.
    We call ''''dynamic'''' a publication of an interactive key on a Web site where
    its contents can be continuously updated. ''''Dynamic'''' publications meet some
    of the criteria of a ''''formal scientific publication'''' (identification, citation
    and location), while they lack other important features of it (persistence, archiving,
    indexing, science metric and citation metric services). Dynamic Web-based interactive
    keys may benefit from publishing the first version of their underlying datasets
    in a form of "formal scientific publication". We define here the minimum set of
    data files to be published for several different platforms (Intkey, Lucid2, Lucid3,
    MX) to ensure both (1) priority, identification, location and citation of the
    firstly published work and (2) future use and re-use of the keys.</p>'

  title: Literature exploration and open access bibliography
  description: |-
    <p>Based on a critical reflection of relevant literature, the review shows that both organized crime and terrorist networks become more and more complex and the diversity of the forms organisations is increasing. Organized crime groups are becoming more and more flexible and divers. Globalisation and the internet have produced international networks, which rely on a broad portfolio of criminal activities that created experts and professionals within the networks. However, despite the globalisation of organized crime activities, ethnicity and kinship still plays a role both at a larger and a smaller scale, as research on local distribution or protection networks has shown.<br>
    Terrorist networks are very much based on ideology and identity, with social marginalisation and institutional change as main drivers of engagement. Regarding the structures, research has shown that the form of organisation is changing from centralized organisations towards networks of cells that act more or less autonomously. This development is facilitated by the digital communication technologies, with terrorist networks having their own experts for encryption and secure communication.<br>
    Other and especially recent approaches emphasize the similarities between organized crime and terrorist networks. Although connections between the phenomena are recognized, critical scholars point out that there are fundamental variations and hence it is crucial to separate them analytically. Organized crime for example is aiming at the accumulation of wealth, whereas terrorist networks are mainly focussing on political or ideological goals and are using criminal activities primarily to finance their structures and attacks.<br>
    Organized crime and terrorist networks represent a serious threat for the European Union as well as on a global level. However, as research has shown, over 90 per cent of terrorist attacks are taking place in non-European countries. Nevertheless, as a conclusion several policy and institutional obstacles for tackling organized crime and terrorist networks are apparent. First, there is a significant Lack of Cooperation between the EU-member states regarding the implementation of supra-national policies. Second, there is a Lack of Skilled Technical Staff, Expertise and Tools. Only few countries have the technologies and the experts for tackling cybercrime. Third, as recent terrorist attacks in Europe showed there is a Lack of Communication between national authorities, which interferes with the aim of tracking criminals or preventing attacks.</p>

  title: Collaborative Use Cases between SSH Open Marketplace and the Language Resource
    Switchboard and Virtual Collection Registry
  description: |-
    <p>The CLARIN Language Resource Switchboard (LRS or Switchboard) serves as an established and valuable asset to provide the user with tools and services for their research data. Apart from looking at an already existing set of research data, moreover, many users would like to search for tools and services from the angle of the research method, a certain technology, interoperability or even just a research question, which calls for the SSH Open Marketplace (MP). The MP not only strives to provide individual items (tools, research data, tutorials, software) to the searching and browsing user, but first and foremost context. Contextualized items in the MP allow for a search serendipity which contributes substantially to the service experience. The LRS promises to be a suitable means to convey such serendipity. For this purpose, the following document outlines possible user stories in favor of its integration into the MP.</p>

    <p>Beyond the LRS-MP relation the document also considers scenarios for the relation of both components to the CLARIN Virtual Collection Registry (VCR). The VCR allows the user to create individual and persistent collections including records from a broad range of sources. Such sources may be repositories exposing research data (the common VCR use case= &rsquo;bibliography of research datasets&rsquo;), but possibly also from other sources such as the MP.</p>

    <p>The overarching goal of the activity in T3.6 is to achieve - wherever useful and technically possible - an integration between CLARIN and DARIAH components, being developed and extended under the SSHOC umbrella. This includes especially the MP, the VCR and LRS. The DARIAH research infrastructure plays an important role in this regard, although this document focuses on the CLARIN LRS and CLARIN VCR as well as the MP.</p>

  title: 'Community-led Open Publication Infrastructures for Monographs (COPIM): Annual
    Report - Year 1 (2019-2020)'
  description: "<p>This report is the first of three annual reports and a major deliverable
    submitted to <a href=\"https://www.arcadiafund.org.uk/\">Arcadia</a> &ndash; a
    charitable fund of Lisbet Rausing and Peter Baldwin, by the Community-Led Open
    Publication Infrastructures for Monographs (COPIM) project.</p>\n\n<p>COPIM is
    committed to exploring possible solutions to some of the most pressing barriers
    currently preventing small publishers from interfacing with large-scale organisations
    and processes. As a result, COPIM is developing a significantly enriched not-for-profit
    and open source ecosystem for OA (open access) book publishing that will support
    and sustain a diversity of publishing initiatives and models, particularly within
    Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS) publishing.</p>\n\n<p>The adoption of alternative
    infrastructures, business models, preservation structures, and governance procedures
    to be scoped and developed through COPIM will enable increased economic resilience
    and enhanced capacities for open access books at smaller and larger scales. COPIM&#39;s
    approach will offer Higher Education institutions and HSS researchers sustainable
    publishing models they control, increased publishing options, and new revenue
    streams and cost reductions to build a more equitable horizontal and co-operative
    knowledge sharing community. During the first year of the project, COPIM has established
    a solid foundation in the areas of collaborative research, infrastructure development,
    project management, and outreach and community building. Successfully adapting
    its approach to face a set of unforeseen challenges, the project has achieved
    the majority of its deliverables and milestones across all work packages, in some
    areas even outperforming the initial goals set.</p>\n\n<p>The list of key output
    and activities delivered includes:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>the <strong>publication
    of two major scoping reports</strong></li>\n\t<li>the successful organisation
    and documentation of <strong>eleven workshops</strong> with <strong>more than
    120 national and international high-profile stakeholders</strong> <strong>representing
    18 countries</strong></li>\n\t<li>the successful switch to an online-only approach
    due to COVID-19, which now includes the setup and iterative extension of an <strong>Outreach
    and Dissemination network</strong> that is combining a variety of channels including
    social media and open community platforms;</li>\n\t<li>and the initial setup and
    continuous further development of a resource to make <a href=\"https://github.com/thoth-pub\"><strong>open
    access book metadata</strong></a> available in an open, transparent and participatory
    way, which will integrate into the larger Open Dissemination System, to be developed
    in Years 2 and 3.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The project has successfully fostered engagement
    with the work packages&rsquo; variety of stakeholders (i.e. librarians, publishers,
    authors, technology providers and the general public), bringing together key experts
    and those interested in learning more about scholar-led not-for-profit OA book
    publishing. Next to its own event organisation and outreach activities, COPIM
    has also been invited to participate in a variety of external conferences, events,
    and networks by organisations and projects such as Invest in Open Infrastructure,
    OASPA, OPERAS, LIBER, the Next Generation Libraries Project, and the Open Access
    Book Network, The British Library, OpenAIRE, COAR, and EIFL.</p>\n\n<p>The overall
    progress made during this first year seems particularly noteworthy as the project
    not only had to face the challenges of first-year setup, including early minor
    delays in staff recruitment, onboarding, and the organisation of basic project
    management and governance structures; COPIM was also faced with a set of unprecedented
    challenges that permeated all aspects of the delivery process and will potentially
    impact the remainder of the project going forward. The main challenges include
    Brexit and its impact on the economy&mdash;and corresponding uncertainties&mdash;and
    the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, with all systemic consequences that this
    entails.</p>\n\n<p>Building on the foundational research, project management structures
    and outreach networks that have been successfully established in Year 1, the project
    is eager to continue on its path to further developing the envisioned infrastructures,
    pilot cases, governance structures, and outreach programmes it is set to deliver
    in Years 2 and 3.</p>"

  title: Open Learning Resource Structures in the Activation of VET Learners
  description: <p>This paper analyses the open structures in the VET practice and
    the methodological impact of the interactive-collaborative approaches in the new
    learning environment focusing on inclusion and exclusion. According to the different
    levels of student motivation and the inhomogeneous nature of learning content
    support, the teaching and learning of the new VET content require methodological
    solutions other than the traditional ones, in which the interactive methods are
    increasingly supported by the developing learning environment, and cooperation
    bears a considerable pedagogical development potential. According to our research
    activities, the Open Content Development (OCD) model, which was based on the results
    of several learning content digitalizing projects, was built upon the recognition
    of the change in the teaching-learning paradigm. Our paper explores the possible
    steps of supporting the under-motivated and highly sensitive group of students
    through a pilot program dedicated to using inclusion and exclusion aspects and
    improving the methodical knowledge of teachers.</p>

  title: Designers Initiating Open Innovation With Multistakeholder Through Co-reflection
    Sessions
  description: <p>This paper explores a designerly approach to open innovation initiation
    as start of the PhD research of the third author. More specifically, it presents
    the application of co-reflection sessions by designers in a healthcare open innovation
    project to initiate multi-stakeholder participation. Integrating co-reflection
    in open innovation initiation provides designers with the opportunity to a) negotiate
    with and function in multi-disciplinary environments consisting of stakeholder
    representatives and stakeholder customers (possible end-users); b) analyze complexity
    and structure of stakeholder ambitions, wishes, concerns and restrictions in order
    to frame a collaboration space; c) synthesize, visualize and materialize the value
    proposition to communicate the benefits to multi-stakeholder networks in order
    to define a design space and motivate their participation; and what is more important,
    keeping the balance between design thinking and design action. Lessons learned
    from this study a) can be used to provide a set of skills and practical guidance
    to designers when initiating open innovation b) define a spectrum for research
    on how designers can initiate innovation.</p>

  title: 'Introducing Nature 4.0: A sensor network for environmental monitoring in
    the Marburg Open Forest'
  description: <p>Successful conservation strategies require frequent observations
    and assessments of the landscape. Although expert surveys provide a great level
    of detail, the trade-off is the limited spatial coverage and repetition with which
    they are executed. Remote sensing technology can partially resolve these issues;
    nevertheless, it still requires experts' experience to create conservation planning
    and reaction options. Nature 4.0 seeks to address these shortcomings by developing
    a prototype of a modular environmental monitoring system for high-resolution observation
    of species, habitats, and processes. The project combines expert surveys by nature
    conservationists, remote sensing, and a network of environmental sensors, which
    are integrated into stationary units as well as attached to unmanned aerial vehicles,
    rovers, or animals. By utilizing powerful data integration and analysis methods,
    Nature 4.0 will enable researchers to effectively observe landscapes through a
    set of diverse lenses. Time series data from the project will also inform the
    development of early warning indicators. Following the open-source principle,
    as much of the project as possible will be made publicly available, including,
    for instance, schematics for sensor units, algorithms for data integration or
    information on species occurrence. In summary, Nature 4.0 will establish new methods
    and protocols in the field of comprehensive environmental monitoring by combining
    traditional sampling, remote sensing, and automated measurement stations. The
    prototype system is being developed in the Marburg Open Forest, an open research,
    education, and development platform for environmental monitoring methods. The
    Marburg Open Forest brings a cross-disciplinary group of scientists together with
    nature conservation experts from the private sector and the state government,
    as well as local schools and private citizens to collaborate and bridge the gap
    between basic and applied environmental research. After one year, we will present
    the results of the initial phase and share our experience with developing Nature
    4.0.</p>

  title: 'System Architecture Optimization: An Open Source Multidisciplinary Aircraft
    Jet Engine Architecting Problem'
  description: |-
    <p>Decisions regarding the system architecture are important and taken early in the design<br>
    process, however suffer from large design spaces and expert bias. Systematic design space<br>
    exploration techniques, like optimization, can be applied to system architecting. Realistic engineering benchmark problems are needed to enable development of optimization algorithms<br>
    that can successfully solve these black-box, hierarchical, mixed-discrete, multi-objective architecture optimization problems. Such benchmark problems support the development of more<br>
    capable optimization algorithms, more suitable methods for modeling system architecture design space, and educating engineers and other stakeholders on system architecture optimization<br>
    in general. In this paper, an engine architecting benchmark problem is presented that exhibits<br>
    all this behavior and is based on the open-source simulation tools pyCycle and OpenMDAO.<br>
    Next to thermodynamic cycle analysis, the proposed benchmark problem includes modules<br>
    for the estimation of engine weight, length, diameter, noise and NOx emissions. The problem<br>
    is defined using modular interfaces, allowing to tune the complexity of the problem, by vary-<br>
    ing the number of design variables, objectives and constraints. The benchmark problem is<br>
    validated by comparing to pyCycle example cases and existing engine performance data, and<br>
    demonstrated using both a simple and a realistic problem formulation, solved using the multi-<br>
    objective NSGA-II algorithm. It is shown that realistic results can be obtained, even though<br>
    the design space is subject to hidden constraints due to the engine evaluation not converging<br>
    for all design points.<br>

  title: 'THE READINESS OF OPEN ACCESS POLICY IMPLEMENTATION: A CASE STUDY WITHIN
    A KUWAITI HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTE'
  description: '<p>Open access (OA) policy is becoming an increasingly important element
    of information management initiatives in academic institutions. The aim of this
    research is to explore the perception towards OA and identify the factors that
    influence the readiness of OA implementation in Kuwaiti higher education institutions.
    A single exploratory case study approach is adopted within one institution, the
    Public Authority for Applied Education and Training (PAAET). This study analyses
    data collected through a questionnaire from 154 stakeholders and 16 semi-structured
    interviews undertaken in PAAET, using the Theory of Organisational Readiness for
    Change (TORC). This research makes contributions to knowledge in: a) understanding
    of organisational factors for potential IT adoption in Kuwaiti higher education
    institutions; b) potential for adoption of OA policies in developing countries;
    c) TORC use in OA policy applicability within the context of a developing country,
    a culture that has never been explored before; and d) generating rich insight
    into understanding OA policy readings of a Kuwaiti Academic Institution. Practical
    contributions suggest that awareness of OA is still low in one Kuwaiti higher
    education (HE) institution (PAAET); however, the study participants were found
    to be supportive of the OA concept. These practical contributions are relying
    on long-term strategic steps such as: a) need for promotion of OA awareness; b)
    ownership of OA by senior management; c) government support at national level;
    d) management processes and OA policy; e) technical infrastructure needs; f) organisational
    restructuring; and g) interdepartmental collaboration. Some short-term proposals
    for action by the authorities in Kuwaiti higher education institutes are suggested,
    such as linking their websites to “The Create Change Organisation” and engaging
    in more international collaboration partnerships such as “Tempus”, which could
    help PAAET coordinate with other academic institutions through Open Innovation
    projects. Keywords: Open access (OA), Open Access Policy (OA policy), Kuwait,

  title: A data-driven approach for understanding Open Design. Mapping social interactions
    in collaborative processes on GitHub
  description: <p>The development and adoption of digital technologies in the past
    decades has modified existing working conditions and introduced new ones in many
    fields and disciplines. This process has also influenced the field of Design especially
    with the Open Design and the Maker movements. The article proposes a software
    library for analysing networks of social interactions over time on Git projects
    hosted on GitHub. Such software may be useful for understanding social interactions
    over time on GitHub, enabling thus an overview of participation in collaborative
    processes and therefore advance our understanding of how platforms connects and
    influence makers and designers in their collaborative work on Open Design. The
    article show its application to three cases of (a) discussing the nature and concepts
    of Open Design, (b) teaching Open Design to interaction design students, (c) the
    development of a platform for Maker laboratories and Open Design projects.</p>

  title: 'Biodiversidata: An Open-Access Biodiversity Database for Uruguay'
  description: |-
    <p>The continental and marine territories of Uruguay are characterised by a rich convergence of multiple biogeographic ecoregions of the Neotropics, making this country a peculiar biodiversity spot. However, despite the biological significance of Uruguay for the South American subcontinent, the distribution of biodiversity patterns in this country remain poorly understood, given the severe gaps in available records of geographic species distributions. Currently, national biodiversity datasets are not openly available and, thus, a dominant proportion of the primary biodiversity data produced by researchers and institutions across Uruguay remains highly dispersed and difficult to access for the wider scientific and environmental community. In this paper, we aim to fill this gap by developing the first comprehensive, open-access database of biodiversity records for Uruguay (Biodiversidata), which is the result of a large-scale collaboration involving experts working across the entire range of taxonomic diversity found in the country.</p>

      <p>As part of the first phase of Biodiversidata, we here present a comprehensive database of tetrapod occurrence records native from Uruguay, with the latest taxonomic updates. The database provides primary biodiversity data on extant Amphibia, Reptilia, Aves and Mammalia species recorded within the country. The total number of records collated is 69,380, spanning 673 species and it is available at the Zenodo repository: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2650169. This is the largest and most geographically and taxonomically comprehensive database of Uruguayan tetrapod species available to date and it represents the first open repository for the country.</p>

  title: A QUALITATIVE STUDY ON USAGE AND EFFECTIVENESS OF MASSIVE OPEN ONLINE COURSES
    (MOOCS) IN  INDIAN UNIVERSITY EDUCATION SYSTEM
  description: <p>Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) is an&nbsp;online course&nbsp;aimed
    at unlimited participation and open access via the web. In addition to traditional
    course materials such as videos, readings, and&nbsp;problem sets, MOOCs provide
    interactive user forums that help build a community for students, professors,
    and&nbsp;teaching assistants. MOOCs have recently received a great deal of attention
    from the media, entrepreneurial vendors, education professionals and technologically
    literate sections of the public. MOOCs will provide free to access cutting edge
    courses to students of higher education in university system. Across the world,
    premier universities have put their courses online by setting up open learning
    platforms, such as edX. Commercial start-ups such as Coursera and Udacity have
    also been launched in collaboration with prestigious universities, offering online
    courses for free or charging a small fee for certification. The rapid expansion
    of MOOCs has sparked commercial interest from venture capitalists and major corporations
    who want to enter the Higher Education (HE) market using a MOOC approach. Students&rsquo;
    motivation to participate in MOOCs is a significant area of interest. Factors
    that influence students&rsquo; motivation to learn include future economic benefit,
    development of personal and professional identity, challenge and achievement,
    enjoyment and fun. What motivates the MOOC learner? Surveys conducted by researchers
    at Duke University show that student motivations typically fell into one of four
    categories viz. a) To support lifelong learning or gain an understanding of the
    subject matter, with no particular expectations for&nbsp; completion or achievement
    b) For fun, entertainment, social experience and intellectual stimulation c)&nbsp;
    Convenience, often in conjunction with barriers to traditional education options
    d) To experience or explore online education (Belanger&nbsp; and Thornton, 2013).
    In order to investigate the usage and effectiveness of Massive Open Online Courses
    (MOOCs) of edX, Coursera, Udacity and Udemy in university system in India, a qualitative
    study was employed by the authors and semi-structured in-depth interviews were
    conducted with students of higher education in Indian universities and teaching
    professionals in university setups. The authors interviewed the participants based
    on a list of questions expanded from the three primary research questions based
    on the awareness, content, usage and learning outcomes. The questions were open-ended,
    which allowed the participants to freely express their experiences, thoughts,
    and feelings about the use of MOOCs. This study demonstrates the awareness, usage
    and effectiveness of MOOCs among students and teaching professionals of Indian
    University system.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

  description: |-
    <p>Poster for IATUL conference 2015</p>

    <p>Digital technologies influence how scientists process information. The changing environment for librarians and data managers strongly redirects to national and international networks between different research institutions. Accessibility and visibility of research output towards &lsquo;openness&rsquo; is part of collaborative working information infrastructure units at non-university research organization like the Leibniz Centre for Agricultural Landscape Research (ZALF). As member of the Leibniz Association, it promotes free exchange of research results according to the Berlin Declaration on Open Access to Knowledge in the Sciences and Humanities.<br />
    ZALF explores ecosystems in agricultural landscapes and the development of ecologically and economically justifiable land use systems. Thereby, the central infrastructure facilities Central Library plus and the Department of Landscape Information Systems jointly support the research process by providing technical solutions for knowledge management and information services.<br />
    Supporting metadata collection, quality controlled data registration and availability of research products in repositories with long-term preservation strategies, ZALF encourages Open Access and data sharing. Consulting, reporting and monitoring the organizational publication process (e.g. by prepay membership and publication funds) are means to enable the researcher&rsquo;s decision towards an opening science. The scientific outcome can be embedded into the linked virtual research environment, so disciplinary, technical and structural synergies evolve.<br />
    The poster presents already established processes, surrounding conditions and challenges within the scientific community as far as future perspectives on developing publication types and Open Data.</p>

    dialogue in the United States concerned with the accessibility, reproducibility,
    and rigor of health research.  This discussion is also closely aligned with the
    need to identify sustainable ways to expand the national research enterprise and
    generate actionable results that can be applied to improve the nation’s health. 
    The principles and practices of <em>Open Science</em> offer a promising path to
    address both goals by facilitating: 1) increased transparency of data and methods
    which promotes research reproducibility and rigor; and 2) cumulative efficiencies
    wherein research tools and the output of research are combined to accelerate the
    delivery of new knowledge in proximal domains resulting in greater productivity
    and a reduction in redundant research investments.  <strong>Methods:</strong>
    AcademyHealth’s Electronic Data Methods Forum (EDMF) implemented a proof-of-concept
    open science platform for health research, known as CIELO (the Collaborative Informatics
    Environment for Learning on Health Outcomes).  EDMF conducted a user-centered
    design process in order to elucidate important and high-level requirements for
    creating and sustaining an open science paradigm. <strong>Results:</strong> By
    implementing CIELO and engaging a variety of potential users in its public beta
    testing, EDMF has been able to elucidate a broad range of stakeholder needs and
    requirements related to the use of an open science platform focused on health
    research in a variety of “real world” settings. <strong>Discussion:</strong> Our
    initial design and development experience over the course of the CIELO project
    has provided the basis for a vigorous dialogue between stakeholder community members
    regarding which capabilities will add the greatest value to an open science platform
    for the health research community.  A number of important questions around user
    incentives, sustainability, and scalability will require further community dialogue
    and agreement. </p>'

  title: OE4BW Open Jam Jar Framework
  description: |-
    <p>This is an openly licensed framework that can be used by educators and students to construc jam, conferences and events, fully online or blended, using creative and active learning approaches with professionals and/or students in higher education or other educational settings.<br>
    <br>
    The ideas for the Open Jam Jar are based on research and practice of the #creativeHE community, the related annual #creativeHE jam and inspired and shaped further by the Global Culture Jam (GCJ) which took place at Manchester Metropolitan University in the United Kingdom in June 2021 and attracted over 1400 sign-ups from different parts of the world. Global Culture Jam is a collaborative project that aims to bring together students and staff to explore and celebrate cross-cultural learning, teaching and living through the following strands: community, sustainability, curriculum and creativity.<br>
    <br>
    These were defined and agreed with the team of collaborators taking into consideration strategic institutional goals, aspirations and as well as wider higher education conversations and areas of focus and exploration that presented rich opportunities to bring diverse views and perspectives together that would be of value for organisers, the institution participants from different parts of the world and the wider academic community.<br>
    <br>
    The team intends to share lessons learnt from the GCJ and make the Open Jam Jar framework available to others to re-use, adapt and re-package to create their own Jam event using the Open Jam Jar framework we have developed.</p>

  title: 'Open Science goes Geo - Part I: Research Data'
  description: |-
    <p>Open Science is a broad movement looking beyond Open Access to publish openly and share scientific research immediately. Accessibility is addressed on all levels for everyone, without fees.</p>

    <p>Open Science not only deals with Open Access papers but scientific research results in general, including figures, data, models, algorithms, software, tools, notebooks, laboratory designs, recipes, samples and much more. Furthermore, it covers the communication, review, and discussion of research results and considers changing needs regarding incentives, quality assessment, metrics, impact, reputation, grants and funding. Thus Open Science encompasses licensing, policy-making, infrastructures and scientific heritage while safeguarding the dynamic nature of science and its evolving forms.</p>

    <p>However, this short course is meant not to carry too far with Open Science. Rather, it looks at what is possible nowadays and what is ready for application in geosciences. The speakers present open data solutions and introduce networks. It is aimed to create an idea on how researchers benefit from Open Science regarding research data. Both the drawbacks and opportunities of open data are outlined.</p>

    <p>This short course is the first part of the Short Course series &#39;Open Science goes Geo&#39;. Part I covers research data and its role in the scientific work. The possibilities for publishing research data leveraging Open Science in geosciences are addressed, together with related opportunities and stumbling blocks. Moreover, the ways in which networks can support scientific collaboration on shared datasets are introduced.</p>

  title: OPEN EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES IN THE CONTEXT OF OPEN ACCESS
  description: '<p><strong>Objective.</strong>&nbsp;This exploratory literature review
    seeks to identify both emergent consensus areas and research gaps in recent scholarly
    literature on Open Educational Resources (OERs). Despite the perception of OERs
    as universally available, these involve persistent barriers. The presence of institutional
    policies, adequate incentives and support frameworks for the use and sharing of
    OERs as well as raising awareness about their availability is likely to be critical
    for their successful deployment.&nbsp;<strong>Methods.</strong>&nbsp;This study
    made use of the case study method to arrive at its conclusions. As part of this,
    secondary data were collected from relevant article searches conducted in Google
    Scholar and at the Harvard Open Access Tagging Project website. Only papers published
    in the last five years, e.g., in the years 2016-2021, were taken into consideration.
    Given that this study has applied the methodology of qualitative comparison and
    case study construction, this limits the validity of its conclusions to the settings
    from which the original primary findings were obtained or for which OER recommendations
    were produced.&nbsp;<strong>Results.</strong>&nbsp;As part of this research, 16
    scholarly articles and research reports were identified as being of relevance
    for this study. The research questions this study has sought to answer are as
    follows: How OERs have developed in recent years? What was the impact of the pandemic
    period on OER use? What are the key barriers for OER deployment? What are the
    facilitating factors for OER implementation at libraries, colleges and universities?
    What are the effects of OERs?&nbsp;<strong>Conclusions.</strong>&nbsp;Recent reports
    indicate that the pandemic period has both increased the awareness of OERs among
    education institutions and provided an impetus for capacity building efforts in
    this domain. Yet, OER effectiveness continues to be under-researched, despite
    a tentative consensus in scholarly literature concerning the critical role for
    OER efficacy of institutional support and collaboration frameworks.</p>'

  title: 'Open innovation systems: main characteristics and trends of internationalization'
  description: |-
    <p>Exploring the peculiarities and trends in innovation development in modern conditions is based on defining its new characteristics caused by postindustrial transformations.</p>

    <p>The aim of writing this article is to study the main elements of open national innovation systems and trends of their integration into international innovation cooperation. In the course of performing the set tasks, we used methods of system and structural–functional analysis to substantiate the main components of open innovation systems and the trends in their formation and operation.</p>

    <p>It was stressed that the main characteristics of open innovation systems are innovation entrepreneurship, innovation networks, innovation cooperation and partnership, innovation clusters and ecosystems. The driving force of modern innovation process is the entrepreneurial innovation activity, covering all stages and areas of system innovation process, relying on innovations in technology, management, market, social and providing for innovative development of the society.</p>

    <p>It was discovered that the innovative collaboration involves its participants in the innovation process with the use of such forms as technology transfer, information exchange, research and educational programs, commercial exchange of innovative products. Innovation partnership combines innovation resources and activities of the participants – setting up innovative enterprises, joint implementation of innovative projects. In the modern period, innovation collaboration and partnership develop at the level of corporations, industries and sectors of national economy and on the international level.</p>

    <p>Development of innovative cooperation and partnership depends on the formation and status of innovation ecosystems as the medium of open innovations. Influenced by global factors, the development of innovation clusters is characterized by the trend of internationalization of innovation activities on the basis of international cooperation among clusters of different countries.</p>

    <p>Innovation development leads to certain transformations in the human capital, growth in the level of its innovativeness and innovation. Internationalization of human capital in innovation occurs on the basis of the development of international scientific and technical cooperation and implementation of social humanitarian programs.</p>

    <p>Directions of formation of open innovation systems are the development of innovation entrepreneurship, innovation networks, innovation cooperation and partnership, innovation ecosystems and clusters. The core of open innovation systems is the human capital of innovation development.</p>

    <p>The scientific novelty of this research made it possible to determine the conditions and factors for the innovation systems to reach various levels of open nature and substantiation of their components and areas of internationalization. The practical significance of the obtained results is application of the materials of this paper by the subjects of innovation activity for managing the innovation process based on the principles of open innovations.</p>

    <p>Further research into defined scientific problem will be focused on the substantiation of features of renewal of human capital of open innovation systems.</p>

  title: '"OPEN EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES RESEARCH PUBLICATIONS: A BIBLIOMETRIC ANALYSIS"'
  description: |-
    <p>The last many decades have seen dramatic changes to education and clearly demonstrated OER&rsquo;s role in democratizing knowledge and empowering learners around the world. OERs are information resources specifically designed to be freely accessed and authorised to be re-used, re-mixed, and re-distributed. By free resource it doesn&#39;t mean that the information is not reliable but it is the most important aspect of the OER that it is open to all. These findings contribute to a broadening perception of the value of OERs and their relevance to the great challenges faced by higher education today. This study intends to explore the recent trends of OER through analysis of its publications. There were a total of 1257 Articles on OER in the Web of Science database which were downloaded and the time span selected was from, 1992-2020. The result shows United States of America exceed in the area of OER publications. Several outcomes regarding the annual trends, top collaborators in terms of journal and institute levels, language, country and the keyword distribution in the highly cited papers, the co-authorship status and the most influential journals and authors are portrayed in this paper.</p>

  title: 'The Role of Libraries as Publishers in the Open Education Landscape: Reflecting
    Modern World Practice of Open Textbooks'
  description: <p><strong>Objective.</strong> The study aims to analyse the experience
    of university libraries in different countries in working with the Open Textbook
    (OT) and to consider the prospects of creating a similar pilot project in Ukraine.&nbsp;<strong>Methods.</strong>
    The analysis covered the world publications (journals, books, conference proceedings,
    posts on social networks) in the field of Library and Information Science, devoted
    to the role of libraries in OT support, that have appeared since 2014. The author
    studied the aspects revealing that publication, namely OT, support services are
    areas with great potential for the future development of academic / university
    libraries.&nbsp;<strong>Results.</strong>Numerous evidence is presented that the
    topic of library as a publisher in OT support is most developed in the universities
    and colleges in economically developed countries, especially in the USA, Canada,
    Australia, and Great Britain. Library strategies for OT projects have been identified.
    The author clarified the nature of the initiatives and partnerships of libraries
    in supporting OT, as well as the basic services and roles of libraries in these
    projects.&nbsp;<strong>Conclusions.</strong> Today, the global practice of Scholarly
    Communication has enough evidence that the functions of the Library, lost in the
    course of evolution, as a Knowledge Publisher have returned under its &ldquo;roof&rdquo;
    and supplemented the existing function of Knowledge Managers. Digital Library
    Publishing (DLP) services in OT support help to change the learning environment
    and life of students (including persons with disabilities), pedagogical practices
    of teachers by means of free textbooks with an open license, as well as to receive
    reputation benefits for the university, improving the image of the latter. The
    possibility of eliminating systemic inequalities in access to academic resources
    increases the significance and changes the role of libraries in open education.
    The successes of Ukrainian librarians in supporting digital scholarly communication
    initiatives and the successful implementation of Open Access support projects
    (repositories, e-journals, e-conferences) give confidence that they can act as
    initiators and key partners in creating affordable textbooks.</p>

  description: |-
    <p>Water disinfection and xenobiotics treatments (for both point-of-use potabilization and hospital wastewater) were assessed. Zeolite and CPC solar concentrated technologies were proposed as alternatives and assessed for remaining and added toxicity (Carryover Toxicity, CT). CT was measured using a multitaxa bioassay and the AMES mutagenicity test.</p>

    <p>The approach was biotechnological throughout. Cell receptors saturation by pollutants and ROS were identified as CT mechanisms in hospital wastewater and sustainable solar photolysis (no oxidants added). Definition of disinfection was refined as DNA (chromosomal and plasmidic) fragmentation. A toolbox for CT data analysis was developed.</p>

    <p>International cooperation with Turkey and Canada was instrumental in this research. Three PhD students and one MSc student published their research. Three solar CPCs and one zeolite batch prototypes were designed and tested.</p>

  title: The Hidden Link Between ERC and FET-Open
  description: <p>ERC and FET-Open are very different funding schemes under Horizon
    2020. To name a few differences &ndash; ERC is an individual grant, while FET-Open
    is a collaborative project. ERC is looking into excellence in basic research,
    while FET-Open is seeking Future and Emerging Technologies and it is by-definition
    more applicative. A FET-Open project is expected to reach proof of concept in
    the scope of the project, while in ERC it is not necessary. The budget structure
    is different, and the list goes on. Still, despite such apparent and basic differences,
    there exists a hidden link which creates a de-facto undocumented overlap between
    ERC and FET-Open. Becoming aware of this undocumented overlap can prove beneficial
    to many. What is this proposed overlap? How can understanding it prove beneficial?
    In this article, we will lay the foundations which link between the two projects
    and create this overlap. Afterwards, we will discuss how to navigate such commonalities
    for a greater benefit.</p>

  title: SOME IMPORTANT ISSUES IN FREE AND OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE
  description: <p>In 1983 Richard Stallman founded the free software movement. According
    to the founder this type of software respects user&rsquo;s freedom and social
    solidarity of development team called community in FOSS terminology. Whereas proprietary
    softwares take away the user&rsquo;s freedom and keep the users helpless. In free
    and open source software the concept of sharing the source code is used. Here
    all the participants are connected through internet. FOSS has grown now in a full
    fledged software development methodology thruought the world. This methodology
    cuts down or reduces the cost of software. Also no country of the world wants
    to waste crores of rupees on softwares which are proprietary as they have an option
    to divert to this new category of software. But all want to be safe by getting
    acquainted with various issues related with free and open source software. Therefore
    the main aim of this article is to highlight the important issues related with
    free and open source software.</p>

  title: 'The SoftPro Project: Synergy-Based Open-Source Technologies for Prosthetics
    and Rehabilitation'
  description: <p>Robotics-enabled technologies for assistive and rehabilitative applications
    have gained an increasing attention, both in academic and industrial research
    settings, as a promising solution for human sensory-motor system recovery. However,
    many constraints remain that limit their effective employment in everyday-life,
    mainly related to cost, usability and users&rsquo; acceptance. The Softpro project
    proposes to completely reverse such paradigm, starting from the analysis of the
    needs from patients and the careful investigation of the sensory-motor human behaviour,
    capitalizing on the framework of synergistic control and soft robotics. The final
    goal is to study and design simple, effective and affordable soft synergy-based
    robotic technologies for the upper limb, such as new prostheses, exoskeletons,
    and assistive devices which can be useful and accessible to a wide audience of
    users. To pursue such an ambitious objective, SoftPro has put together research
    groups who laid the neuroscientific and technological fundamentals underpinning
    the project approach, a net of international collaborations and numerous and qualified
    industrial partners, which is expected to produce a strong impact on both research
    and innovation.</p>

    for Smart Manufacturing
  description: |-
    <p>ABSTRACT<br>
    This paper discusses the design of a Digital Twin (DT) demonstrator for Smart Manufacturing, following<br>
    an open source approach for implementation. Open source technology can comprise of software,<br>
    hardware and hybrid solutions that nowadays drive Smart Manufacturing. The major potential of<br>
    open source technology in Smart Manufacturing lies in enabling interoperability and in reducing the<br>
    capital costs of designing and implementing new manufacturing solutions. After presenting our<br>
    motivation to adopt an open source approach for the design of a DT demonstrator, we identify the<br>
    major implementation requirements of Smart Cyber Physical Systems (CPSs) and DTs. A conceptualisation<br>
    of the core components of a DT demonstrator is provided and three technology building blocks for<br>
    the realisation of a DT have been identified. These technology building blocks include components for<br>
    the management of data, models and services. From the conceptual model of the DT demonstrator, we<br>
    derived a high-level micro-services architecture and provided a case study infrastructure for the<br>
    implementation of the DT demonstrator based on available open source technologies. The paper closes<br>
    with research questions to be addressed in the future.</p>

  title: 'TWO!EARS Deliverable D3.2 - Software Architecture, progress (WP3: Feature
    extraction, object formation & meaning assignment; FP7-ICT-2013-C TWO!EARS FET-Open
    Project 618075)'
  description: |-
    <p>The goal of the Two!Ears project is to develop an intelligent, active computational model of auditory perception and experience in a multi-modal context. At the heart of the project is a software architecture that optimally fuses prior knowledge with the currently available sensor input, in order to find the best explanation of all available information. Top-down feedback plays a crucial role in this process. The software architecture will be implemented on a mobile robot endowed with a binaural head and stereo cameras, allowing for active exploration and understanding of audiovisual scenes. Our approach recasts a conventional &ldquo;blackboard system&rdquo; in a modern machine learning framework. In the blackboard system, knowledge sources cooperate to solve a problem; in this case, the problem is to identify the acoustic sources that are present in the environment and ascribe meaning to them.</p>

    <p>This deliverable documents our progress on the design and development of the Two!Ears software architecture. We have developed a blackboard system with three layers. In the first layer, the acoustic input is pre-segmented using information about pitch, onsets/offsets, interaural coherence and amplitude modulation. This allows sound sources of interest to be separated from the acoustic background. Visual information gathered from cameras (or initially from a 3D simulation) are also segmented. Since sound sources of interest in the environment will not be static, we have also developed a framework for nonlinear tracking of sound sources which models their underlying motion dynamics. In the second layer of the expert system, audio-visual events are labelled to indicate their attributes. So far, we have focused on attributes relating to the spatial location of sound events and their source type (e.g., &lsquo;female voice&rsquo; or &lsquo;telephone ring&rsquo;). Correctly labelling these attributes in noisy and reverberant acoustic environments is a challenging problem; we have developed techniques for improving the robustness of spatial location estimation (using multi-condition training and head movements) and source type classification (using noise-adaptive linear discriminant analysis). We have also developed an i-vector approach to speaker recognition which gives very promising results. In the third layer of the blackboard system, events are interpreted to derive a meaningful description of the auditory scene. We aim to achieve this within a graphical model framework, based on the open-source software toolkit GMTK. To date, we have demonstrated how sound source localisation can be cast within this framework.</p>

  title: Adoption of Open Innovation in the Internationalization of Knowledge Intensive
    Firms
  description: Involvement in different open innovation activities by using inflows
    and outflows of knowledge becomes the important premise for a successful business.
    However, on a global scale, open innovation literature does not pay enough attention
    to the international dimension, which is essential when seeking to increase the
    performance of overseas firm's activities. Therefore, the paper aims to highlight
    coherences of open innovation and internationalization by analyzing knowledge
    intensive SMEs in Lithuania. Referring to case studies approach it is disclosed
    how much firms are open in performing innovative activities by collaborating,
    how they share knowledge, what main profiles of national and foreign partners
    are and how open innovation is applied in internationalizing firm's activity.
    The research results indicated that while innovating firms were mostly focused
    on the R&amp;D ecosystem oriented and innovation and entrepreneurship ecosystem

    because, CBD, though present in the majority of marijuana, is not a contributing
    factor to the drug&#39;s narcotic qualities. The substance that is responsible
    for this, referred to as THC is present on the plant. Thus, during the production
    of Earlybird CBD Oil, the THC substance is eliminated. The formula&#39;s engineers
    ensure that there isn&#39;t any THC substance within the finished product. This

    System, responsible for making CBD internally and for alleviating discomfort.
